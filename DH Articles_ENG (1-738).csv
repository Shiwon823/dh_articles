Arts are quantified in expectations of extending forms of communication with people and our environments, by creating humanistic ways of interfacing with machines. Within the experience economy the term ‘immersion’ is overused trending towards VR, which has troubled many researchers and practitioners across disciplines. Drawing on perspectives from performance studies, digital humanities, and human-computer interaction (HCI), this paper reviews the role of XR-enabling technologies, beyond VR, in designing immersive experiences, and their integration into performance practices. It discusses the shift of the artist’s role in imagineering new resources and new ways of working to immerse audiences, and it evaluates this in a postdigital context. It discusses how immersion operates, and critiques components necessary to create affective environments in terms of audience engagement, agency, participation, involvement, presence, embodiment and interaction. The article discusses how performance as a lab can act as a method of inquiry by bringing the anthropological, performative and theatrical perspectives; and the ethics of to testing immersive-enabling technologies and/or experiences within the context of live performances.","https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=202120712714&site=ehost-live"

La creazione di software ne costituisce un elemento fondamentale. Mentre i dati raccolti sono di regola punto di partenza e d'arrivo della ricerca, i processi trasformativi che, basati su calcoli algoritmici, conducono dall'uno all'altro, rappresentano lo sforzo intellettuale decisivo e vanno considerati il vero risultato scientifico. Il software dedicato alla ricerca scientifica nasce di solito nel corso di un processo creativo e combinatorio molto complesso che dipende da molteplici legami con altre risorse. Il ciclo di vita del software in questione è molto più breve e molto più soggetto a influenze esterne rispetto a quello dei classici dati di ricerca. Come forma particolare dei dati di ricerca, il software pone pertanto sfide particolari al processo di sviluppo e a una gestione sostenibile dei dati. Il riconoscimento del software come risultato di ricerca, la creazione di strutture istituzionali che offrono opportunità di carriera agli sviluppatori e alle sviluppatrici, e l'integrazione del software in infrastrutture sostenibili di dati di ricerca sono la chiave per un'attività di ricerca più trasparente e più qualificata. The Digital Humanities (DH) can be regarded as the development and exploration of digital methods for answering research questions in the humanities. In this context, software development is a central part of humanities research. While data is usually the starting and end point of a research process, the intermediate transformation process formulated by algorithms is the main intellectual achievement and can thus also be regarded as a genuine scientific output. Software development is a highly complex, creative and combinatorial process characterized by numerous dependencies on other resources. In contrast to classic research data, the life cycle of research software is much shorter and far more susceptible to external influences. As a special instance of research data, software therefore poses special challenges for the development process and for sustainable data management. The appreciation of software as a research output, the creation of institutional structures for reliable career paths and the integration of software into sustainable research data infrastructures are the keys to more transparent and qualitatively improved research practice.

"A Benchmark Dataset for Repetitive Pattern Recognition on Textured 3D Surfaces.","Lengauer, Stefan; Sipiran, Ivan; Preiner, Reinhold; Schreck, Tobias; Bustos, Benjamin","Computer Graphics Forum",="01677055",,="Aug2021","40","5","1","8","152037992","10.1111/cgf.14352","Wiley-Blackwell","Article","AUTOMATIC identification; DIGITAL humanities; SOURCE code; CULTURAL property; GEOMETRIC analysis; Historical Sites","CCS Concepts; Computing methodologies → Image processing; General and reference → Metrics; Information systems → Evaluation of retrieval results; Retrieval efficiency","In digital archaeology, a large research area is concerned with the computer‐aided analysis of 3D captured ancient pottery objects. A key aspect thereby is the analysis of motifs and patterns that were painted on these objects' surfaces. In particular, the automatic identification and segmentation of repetitive patterns is an important task serving different applications such as documentation, analysis and retrieval. Such patterns typically contain distinctive geometric features and often appear in repetitive ornaments or friezes, thus exhibiting a significant amount of symmetry and structure. At the same time, they can occur at varying sizes, orientations and irregular placements, posing a particular challenge for the detection of similarities. A key prerequisite to develop and evaluate new detection approaches for such repetitive patterns is the availability of an expressive dataset of 3D models, defining ground truth sets of similar patterns occurring on their surfaces. Unfortunately, such a dataset has not been available so far for this particular problem. We present an annotated dataset of 82 different 3D models of painted ancient Peruvian vessels, exhibiting different levels of repetitiveness in their surface patterns. To serve the evaluation of detection techniques of similar patterns, our dataset was labeled by archaeologists who identified clearly definable pattern classes. Those given, we manually annotated their respective occurrences on the mesh surfaces. Along with the data, we introduce an evaluation benchmark that can rank different recognition techniques for repetitive patterns based on the mean average precision of correctly segmented 3D mesh faces. An evaluation of different incremental sampling‐based detection approaches, as well as a domain specific technique, demonstrates the applicability of our benchmark. With this benchmark we especially want to address the geometry processing community, and expect it will induce novel approaches for pattern analysis based on geometric reasoning like 2D shape and symmetry analysis. This can enable novel research approaches in the Digital Humanities and related fields, based on digitized 3D Cultural Heritage artifacts. Alongside the source code for our evaluation scripts we provide our annotation tools for the public to extend the benchmark and further increase its variety.

However, in both cases there are important distinctions to be made between various categories of prototypes. In general, there are three categories of prototype, which are intended for experiment, development, and provocation respectively. Although it might be argued that the overlap between these three groups renders them useless, if they are construed correctly, it becomes clear that the distinctions are not only meaningful, but can also be suggestive of new methods of working.

The proposed model, which resembles a knowledge-related network, is useful for the multidimensional display of resources and is facilitative to in-depth explorations in COM research. Supplemented by visual examples, this model can demonstrate the aggregative and escalating processes (from data to information and then to knowledge linkage) of COM. This model provides assistance for scholars in this field to more efficiently approach COM research and enriches the research on oral memory (OM) of digital humanities at the same time.

Following other disciplines that have developed in symbiotic relationships to one another, DCS puts computation in conversation with fields from across the arts, humanities, physical, and social sciences. Our foundational premise is the bidirectional influence between these disciplines and digital artifacts and computation. The 4As (artifact, architecture, abstraction, and agency) benefit from both the scepticism of the liberal arts in the face of ubiquitous digital processes and the analytical opening for examining questions pertaining to creative and imaginative alternatives to the digital and computational status quo.

Copyright ownership issues and related contests over rights risk impeding higher education's ability to serve as a cultural and knowledge commons, a specially constructed space where human and artifactual resources interact in ways that benefit society at large. At present, copyright concerns raised by trends involving student entrepreneurship, the digital humanities, and the digitization of special collections material housed in campus libraries threaten higher education's potential to benefit society to the fullest. This Article reviews developments in these three areas of higher education through the lens of copyright, examining, in particular, the copyright ownership - as opposed to use - questions they present. In these emerging contexts, institutional claims to copyright often work to the detriment of students, faculty, and the public. Also harmful are campus copyright policies that are ambiguously worded or inappropriately purport to vest ownership interests in colleges and universities. Resolving these copyright concerns developing in higher education will require amending copyright law and corresponding campus copyright policies. This Article proposes three solutions, each of which would better align applicable laws with our moral expectations for higher education: (1) creating a legal presumption that students own all of the works that they create while students, (2) creating a legal presumption that faculty own nearly all of the works that they create as faculty, and (3) creating two legal prohibitions: one that prevents campus libraries from accepting gifts in which the donor claims copyright or seeks to impose analogous access and use restrictions, and another that prevents institutions from claiming copyright in the donated materials or any derivative works created with them. Together, these proposals help further a vision of higher education as a cultural and knowledge commons - a sector that exists in the public sphere to advance social welfare and responsible economic development to the greatest extent possible.

The development of DH requires strong technological systems, mostly related to patents. We apply patentometrics to probe into the related patent issues in DH and discusses the development of patent technologies such as virtual reality, ontology, 3D modeling, text mining, and GIS that affect the research of DH. We find that the international research on DH is not closely related to patent technology through citation analysis, though it shares disciplinary characteristics. The fluctuations of patent applications such as virtual reality, ontology, 3D modeling, text mining, and GIS are consistent with the trends of DH research. We reveal that the application of a related technical patent could promote the research of DH.

To this end, findings summarized for spatial statistical analyses of selected Susie Rosmarin paintings (which are reminiscent of visualizations of certain mathematical quantities known as eigenvectors), remotely sensed images that have appeared in art exhibits, and selected famous paintings by historically renowned artists reveal that spatial autocorrelation constitutes a fundamental element of art. These analyses extend the tradition of visualizing fractals as art, and interfacing cartography with art.

The site hosts Google Earth software produced interfaces with the EXHIBIT Timeline functions made available by the Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments (SIMILE) project, developed and hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Library. This paper's case study maps the biographical lifepath of the writer Samuel Beckett using digital humanities techniques such as ergodicity, and deformance. The geo-digital-timeline mapping of his biography allows us to visualize the shift in Beckett's literary perspective from a latent Cartesian verisimilitude to more phenomenological and fragmented, existential impressions of time and place. The atlas's visualizations of his Wanderjahre years in various European metropoles chart the intellectual and aesthetic influences shaping the Beckettian literary landscapes of his later and better-known works, such as En Attendant Godot (1953). Beckett's thought, works, and shifts in perception provide insight into how digital cultural mapping practices and third wave digital humanities methodologies and tools can be conceptualized and operationalized.

This article addresses the question of how current computational text-mining approaches can be used as tools for clarifying what aesthetics is when such approaches are combined with philosophical analyses of the field. We suggest that conjoining the two points of view leads to a fuller picture than excluding one or the other, and that such a picture is useful for the self-understanding of the discipline. Our analysis suggests that text-mining tools can find sources, relations, and trends in a new way, but it also reveals that the databases that such tools use are presently seriously limited. However, computational approaches that are still in their infancy in aesthetics will most likely gradually affect our understanding about the ontological status of the discipline and its instantiations.

The field of onomastics examines the linguistic roots and historical development of names, which have for the most part only standardized into single officially recognized forms since the late nineteenth century. Even slight spelling variations can introduce errors in geotagging techniques, and these differences in place-name spellings are thus vital considerations when seeking high rates of correct geospatial identification in historical texts. This article offers an overview of typical name-based variation that can cause issues in the accurate geotagging of any historical resource. The article argues that careful study and documentation of these variations can assist in the development of more complete onymic records, which in turn may inform geo-taggers through a cycle of variational recognition. It demonstrates how patterns in regional naming variation and development, across both specific and generic name elements, can be identified through the historical records of each known location. The article uses examples taken from a digitized corpus of writing about the English Lake District, a collection of 80 texts that date from between 1622 and 1900. Four of the more complex spelling-based problems encountered during the creation of a manual gazetteer for this corpus are examined. Specifically, the article demonstrates how and why such variation must be expected, particularly in the years preceding the standardization of place-name spellings. It suggests how procedural developments may be undertaken to account for such geo-referential issues in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) strategies employed by future projects. Similarly, the benefits of such multigenre corpora to assist in completing onomastic records is also shown via examples of new name forms discovered for prominent sites in the Lake District. This focus is accompanied by a discussion of the influence of literary works on place-name standardization—an aspect not typically accounted for in traditional onomastic study—to illustrate the extent to which authorial interests in regional toponymic histories can influence linguistic development.

This paper will focus on the rationale behind the design and implementation of two related studies conducted in the context of two European e-Infrastructures projects, DARIAH and EHRI. Within DARIAH the challenge involved conducting, analysing and understanding research practices of arts and humanities researchers, a largely ill-defined community encompassing a wide spectrum of disciplines. Each of them deals with a variety of objects employing an extensive number of methods. In the context of EHRI, the challenge is slightly different, due to the involvement of a better-defined research community. Holocaust researchers share well-identified objects, common ground on methods, and handle similar setbacks. In this paper we discuss the approach adopted for designing and implementing qualitative user-centric studies aimed at capturing activities, methods, and types of information objects employed by researchers grounded in identified research goals and questions. It addresses both generic and specific entities and processes, and supports the understanding of researchers' working practices in settings as diverse and wide as DARIAH, or as specialized as EHRI. The outcomes of the analysis of working practices are used in determining user requirements for digital infrastructures to serve the respective research communities.

In the mature years of print, publishers, librarians, and scholars had clearly defined and segregated roles. In the digital realm, the boundaries have broken down. Just now we have hybridity of form and of roles in the implementation of new reading environments. Analysis: This article provides: 1) an overview of e-reading environments; 2) a survey of the Dynamic Table of Contexts interface; and 3) a report on the hybrid production process of a particular online text, Regenerations. Conclusion and implications: Regenerations could only have emerged from a collaboration among a digital infrastructure project, research project, university press, and digital humanities tool suite.

Ongoing integration of digital technologies into both fields is extending this collaboration's scope by facilitating rapid information exchange, integration of multiple datasets in digital formats, and accumulation and analysis of large datasets. Recent research by the Maya Hieroglyphic Database Project, for example, has deployed social network analysis to correlate ritual practice, discourse, and material culture with political interactions. Similarly, epigraphers and archaeologists of pre-Angkorian and Angkorian Southeast Asia have conducted spatial analysis to illuminate the relationship between economy, human mobility, and land use.

Divided into three sections, it first surveys matters regarding the digital archive in general, examining the impact of the media on the institutional and cultural significance of archives, their scope and accessibility, the complexities of their preservation and, crucially, the scholarship produced in and around them. The second section explores how digital archives of both digitized materials and borndigital ones have intersected with the origin and consolidation of the Digital Humanities in the US, underscoring the way these intersections have fostered the development of suitable methodologies and vocabularies to examine digitized and born-digital cultural products. The third section explores a handful of Mexican projects developed in the last few years, and proposes that Mexican digital literary scholarship is unique in its emphasis on decolonial perspectives, community building and recovery, education and training, and new creative expressions.

In tracking the different editions of the Norton and Heath anthologies of American literature, the tool becomes particularly adept at identifying diachronic and nonce canons—texts that appear to identify an inner core over time and those that circulate at its edges. In our essay, we also note that while racial and ethnic diversity have generally expanded, that expansion has come in spurts and in some ways stalled. Moreover, geographic diversity has remained static, or even shrunk. Finally, the essay considers how the presentation of material in anthologies shapes interpretation. The anthology—as a form, as a genre—seems to reinforce historicist approaches to early American literature, and recent selections of texts suggest that the field has moved even further toward emphasizing such historicist methods. Ultimately, we hope to advance a discussion about anthologies and the texts they make most readily available for teaching early American literature.

They are interestingly close to the cultural techniques that preside to the production of knowledge and to art-related practices, such as curating, exhibiting and critique, which seems to bring testimony to the triumph of the so-called 'knowledge society' and 'creative economy'. But, while both scientific knowledge and cultural industry are rapidly relying on algorithms, automated analysis and data visualisation to deal with the exponential growth of data, cultural institutions and humanities are still struggling to decide in what terms are they going to enter the digital age, although they are already being transformed through the infrastructure of digital archives and digital media. This proposal will reflect upon the meaning of activities such as curating, displaying and critique, that have shaped the worlds of art and culture over the last century and upon their redefinition by the mathematics and geometry that are developping the new information geographies of the cultural economy.

"Artificial Intelligence, 3D Documentation, and Rock Art—Approaching and Reflecting on the Automation of Identification and Classification of Rock Art Images.","Horn, Christian; Ivarsson, Oscar; Lindhé, Cecilia; Potter, Rich; Green, Ashely; Ling, Johan","Journal of Archaeological Method & Theory",="10725369",,="Mar2022","29","1","188","26","155313391","10.1007/s10816-021-09518-6","Springer Nature","Article","PETROGLYPHS; ROCK art (Archaeology); DOCUMENTATION; ARTIFICIAL intelligence; IMAGE retrieval; AUTOMATIC classification; CONVOLUTIONAL neural networks; DIGITAL humanities; SCANDINAVIA","3D documentation; Digital humanities; Faster R-CNN; Machine learning; Rock art; Visualization","Rock art carvings, which are best described as petroglyphs, were produced by removing parts of the rock surface to create a negative relief. This tradition was particularly strong during the Nordic Bronze Age (1700–550 BC) in southern Scandinavia with over 20,000 boats and thousands of humans, animals, wagons, etc. This vivid and highly engaging material provides quantitative data of high potential to understand Bronze Age social structures and ideologies. The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence. The reflections and the success represented by the trained models open novel avenues for future research on rock art.

While distant reading, for example, in one language is relatively straightforward, computation across languages poses epistemo-semiotic challenges. What it is here to overcome, among other things, is technological conformism rooted in predominantly monolingual digital textual scholarship; disembodied textual ontologies that arise from some reductive forms of quantitative reading as well as the hierarchical discretization of a text; and, finally, thin computing that gratifies the notions of text as inscription rather than as experience, which echoes the problem raised by Geertz's anthropological concept of 'thick description'. By drawing on my research into the design of cross-linguistic distant reading and the modelling of repetition strings as equivalents of dynamic translatorial response, I will discuss a possibility of thick computing as suspended between textual surfaces and depths.

The author was one of the earliest representatives of computer applications within historical research in Germany, later being appointed to the first professorship for computer applications in the Humanities in Germany outside of linguistics. The following text describes his experiences as part of that development, which lead from the beginnings in the seventies to the current state of ""Digital Humanities"". His view on this development of an interdisciplinary area left him with rather mixed memories: behind a sparkling front story of an enfolding field, he frequently had the feeling that there was a tendency to ignore the huge epistemic potential of a serious attempt to apply computer science to the field of history in favor of glamorous but shallow short term goals.

Our survey of text analysis packages includes those of our own creation (cleanNLP and fasttextM) as well as packages built by other research groups (stringi, readtext, hyphenatr, quanteda, and hunspell). By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project. Throughout, the focus is on moving beyond the bag-of-words, lexical frequency model by incorporating linguistically-driven analyses in research.

Intensive workshops fall between the one-shot session and credit course formats more commonly found in library instruction. Drawing on case studies from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) instruction at DH institutes at the University of California Berkeley and Purdue University, the authors explore the origins of librarian involvement, course topics, pedagogy, and library services. Based on their instruction experiences in the DH summer institutes and student surveys, the authors argue that intensive instruction workshops provide a good potential platform for library involvement in DH.

As Mark Anthony Neal understands it, the transition from one type of anthem to another (from hymn to hip hop) represents a generational shift in the sounds of Black resistance.[15] Within the framing of the film's soundtrack, Neal presents the idea of the Black musical archive: a widely circulating musical network that made Black resistance legible in multiple registers. Mark Anthony Neal has published widely in print about the social and political power of Black music. Neal, ""'Swinging While I'm Singing.'"" Neal quotes Chuck D, who describes the motivation for ""Fight the Power"" as follows: ""New York had a lot of issues and needed an anthem."".

Because it is radically interactive and can permit viewers or listeners to modify a work directly by means of their cerebral activity, such art illuminates the role of audience members in shaping that work's meaning; in this way, it literalizes reader-response theory and allows the public to engage even with opaque or alienating pieces. BCI-based art also reframes the significance of the artist's intentions, prompting a reconsideration of the truism that 'the author is dead', both by positing a collective form of authorship and by granting a creator access to her own unconscious impulses. Finally, via the notion that it may be possible to transfer unfiltered ideas between brains, BCI-inspired artworks provide a new perspective on art as mediation. Although artists have traditionally been praised for seeming to grant direct access to their emotions, one could argue that artistry happens in the act of concretizing and externalizing one's ideas – that is, in the mediated translation of thought rather than in thought itself. The essay concludes by discussing the implications of this theoretical framework for (among other fields) the digital humanities.

The authors focus on humanities data and its visualization, through analysis of their own recent projects with museums, archives and libraries internationally. Their account connects the specifics of hands-on digital humanities work to larger epistemological questions. They discuss the sources of potential mistrust, and examine how different expectations and assumptions emerge depending on the use and user of the data; they offer a simple schema through which the implications may be traced. It is argued that vital issues of trust can be engaged with through design, which, rather than being conceived as a cosmetic finish, is seen as contributing insights and questions that affect the whole process. The article concludes with recommendations intended to be useful in both theory and practice.

The International Tracing Service archives offer process-generated documents from resettlement programs for displaced persons (DP) after World War II. This paper addresses two key challenges to ongoing research based on those archival holdings: the generation of data; and the visual representation of that data in geographic information systems. Digital history offers the opportunity to go beyond case studies and use the wealth of process-generated documents as serial sources for algorithm-based analysis. However, data in that form does not exist as such, and thus needs to be generated - a process that implies interpretative acts such as abstraction, normalization, and trans-coding, which are shaped by the character of digital media. Can modeling a DP's life into a series of events, and digitally processing the resultant data, help to find out more about the agency of DPs negotiating their destiny with the authorities? If the mostly hidden and implicit configurations of digital knowledge production are thoughtfully considered and geostatistical analysis is combined with close readings of selected source documents, hermeneutic and quantitative approaches can be reconciled via digital history. This mixed method approach has implications for research culture and the publication of such data.

The article shows how concerns about sociotechnical transparency raised in the digital humanities and computer science are also embedded in musical technologies to advocate for greater awareness and action regarding implicit biases currently operating in musical spheres. The article finds that shared technology among many kinds of electronic music facilitates a kind of musical 'code-switching' across genres that, if attuned to appropriately in database administration and keyword designations, would minimise racializing and gendering biases in electronic music categorisation.

Many digital humanities projects tend to model their data based on CIDOC-CRM ontology, which offers a wide array of classes appropriate for storing humanities and cultural heritage data. The CIDOC-CRM ontology model leads to a knowledge graph structure in which many entities are often linked to each other through chains of relations, which means that relevant information often lies many hops away from their entities. In this paper, we present a method based on graph walks and text processing to extract entity information and provide semantically relevant embeddings. In the process, we were able to generate similarity recommendations as well as explore their underlying data structure. This approach was then demonstrated on the Sphaera Dataset which was modeled according to the CIDOC-CRM data structure.

As a reaction to the changes in the diplomatic material at the end of the 13th century (in connection with the changes of stylization e.g. because of the permeation of the principles of Canon and Roman law into the charters or an influence of professional notaries educated in the domestic notary school in Vyšehrad, or with regard to the emergence of the official books, especially formularies), the editors decided to change a concept of issuing of CDB. In the first phase there will be processed and finished the second part of “Katalog listin a listů k VII. dílu Českého diplomatáře” and its on-line publishing in a form of database on website. The second phase will be connected with the preparation of the critical edition in a traditional printed as well as a digital form. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Edice Codex diplomaticus et epistolaris regni Bohemiae (dále Český diplomatář, CDB) je vědecká kritická edice, která má za úkol zpřístupnit veškerý diplomatický materiál přemyslovského období, tj. do nástupu lucemburské dynastie na český trůn v roce 1310. Doposud bylo vydáno pět kompletních dílů edice (tzn. samotných edičních svazků edice a rejstříků k jednotlivým dílům), z šestého dílu (období prvního interregna 1278-1283) je zatím k dispozici vlastní ediční svazek. V současné době se na pracovišti Codex diplomaticus et epistolaris regni Bohemiae při Ústavu pomocných věd historických a archivnictví na Masarykově univerzitě připravuje díl sedmý pro období 1283-1306, z něhož byl vydán pátý svazek věnující se písařům a šestý svazek zaměřující pozornost na pečeti z uvedeného období. Vydávání edice CDB zahájil na počátku 20. století Gustav Friedrich, který zvolil jako východisko pro ediční zpracování nejstaršího bohemikálního diplomatického materiálu zásady, které pro řadu Diplomata edičního podniku Monumenta Germaniae Historica vypracoval Theodor Sickel (tzv. Sickelova metoda). Friedrichův žák a pokračovatel ve vydá- vání CDB Jindřich Šebánek pak vnesl do metody zpracování listin v Českém diplomatáři nové elementy, základní premisa však zůstala stejná - vyhodnocení prostředí vzniku listin za použití Sickelovy metody a za předpokladu, že listiny vznikají buď u vydavatele, nebo u příjemce. Jiný způsob vyhotovení (např. ve smyslu pozdějšího veřejného notariátu, tzn. třetí, nezainteresovanou stranou) nebyl brán v potaz. Diplomatická analýza listin současně stála na předpokladu, že až do konce přemyslovské éry je možné v jednotlivých listinách rozpoznat tzv. individuální styl notářů, resp. stylizátorů. Předběžné sondy v pramenech zmíněného období (1283-1306) ovšem ukázaly podstatné změny v diplomatickém materiálu. Pronikání kanonického a římského práva do struktur společnosti, existence notářské školy na Vyšehradě, vznik úředních knih a především aktivní používání formulářových sbírek na konci 13. století mohou ovlivnit (a v některých případech prokazatelně ovlivňují) znění i celkový charakter diplomatického materiálu. Tyto změny tak postavily editory nového dílu CDB před otázku, zda je možné nadále bezvýhradně přijímat dosavadní metody vytvořené pro zpracování příslušných pramenů a zda nebude potřeba přehodnotit některá metodická východiska pro zpracování posledních dílů CDB. Změna v metodickém přístupu si tak vynutila i změnu v edičním plánu vydávání CDB. Materiál z nových svazků VII. dílu bude vydán ve dvou fázích. V první fázi bude dopracován a vydán druhý díl Katalogu listin a listů k VII. dílu Českého diplomatáře (pro léta 1297-1306) a následně celý Katalog publikován on-line ve formě databáze. Druhá fáze bude již spojena s vydáním vlastního sedmého dílu CDB, a to v podobě jak tištěných svazků, tak i on-line edice.

Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake District's soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful focus since it allows us to draw fruitful parallels between our methods and those applied by the writers we study. In this way, this article advocates for digital humanities scholarship that advances our disciplines in conversation with appropriate historical modes.

Thanks to large scale data storage and processing, close reading of individual items can be supplemented with analysis of broader trends from massive amounts of data. Cultural Analytics (CA) is a recently developed methodology for the exploration of content and visual form in large image and video collections. It has already been applied to a variety of media types, including TV programs, feature films, newspapers, and video games. However, until now these applications did not take into account the social context of media. In many cases, media artifacts under scrutiny are generated or used by people in a social setting, either in forms of (digital) communities, or in terms of social relations, which can be also analyzed as a valuable source of information. Social network analysis (SNA) is a set of methods for the analysis of human networks, including massive online social networks. In this article, we argue that CA and SNA can be combined synergistically, using data and images from deviantArt, the leading online network of user-created art, as a case study.

Although such uncertainty can jeopardize the validity of the data analysis, it is often overlooked in visualizations, due to it being indirect and non-quantifiable. In this paper we present two case studies within the digital humanities in which we examined how to integrate uncertainty in our visualization designs. Using these cases as a starting point we propose four considerations for data visualization research in relation to indirect, qualitative uncertainty: (1) we suggest that uncertainty in visualization should be examined within its socio-technological context, (2) we propose the use of interaction design patterns to design for it, (3) we argue for more attention to be paid to the data generation process in the humanities, and (4) we call for the further development of participatory activities specifically catered for understanding qualitative uncertainties. While our findings are grounded in the humanities, we believe that these considerations can be beneficial for other settings where indirect uncertainty plays an equally prevalent role.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), one of the increasingly prevalent manifestations of neurodiversity within higher education, presents significant challenges to students interacting with academic resources and producing traditional scholarly outputs. Traditional scholarship presupposes that students possess a certain level of ability to interact with their course materials, analyze that interaction, and then write both about their interaction and analyses. However, limitations in working memory and Theory of Mind create additional barriers for students with ASD in meeting these presumptions. Fortunately, emerging scholarly practices within the digital humanities now provide more equitable mediums for scholastic output as well as new opportunities for students to access and interact with course content and materials. While current structures within academia presuppose that students are able to interact with materials in a specific way, libraries are uniquely positioned to collaborate with constituent departments and services across campuses of higher education to teach students emerging strategies to more effectively interact with scholarly materials.

So far, narratologists have mostly neglected this progression, which is also known as the digital turn. While the current developments have called our attention to phenomena such as narrative representation across media, the core of narrative theory is still firmly rooted in concepts constructed from the basis of verbal structures and content that can be deemed fixed or unconditional. This article argues that we need to extend the scope of narratological inquiry toward the machines of computational media. With the help of conceptual tools borrowed from software studies and digital humanities, the article first identifies three main properties which distinguish the computer from the earlier forms of media: database, procedurality, and reciprocity. It is then shown how these properties challenge some of the core concepts of narrative theory--plot, character, and storyworld--in the analysis of storytelling in computational media. Finally, it is suggested that in the future, narrative theory might put more emphasis on, firstly, authorship as design and, secondly, the performative acts that the designs invite and enable. The article thus points toward understanding the transformative effect of computational media on the ways in which we see the world and engage with it through the time-honored gift for storytelling.

It departs from observations about working practices in Humanities disciplines following a hermeneutic tradition of text interpretation versus the method-oriented research strategies in Computational Linguistics (CL). The respective praxeological traditions are quite different. Yet more and more researchers are willing to open up towards truly transdisciplinary collaborations, trying to exploit advanced methods from CL within research that ultimately addresses questions from the traditional Humanities disciplines and the Social Sciences. The article identifies two central workflow-related issues for this type of collaborative project in the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Science: (1) a scheduling dilemma, which affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective) and (2) the subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of intersubjective stability of the target categories of analysis. CL methodology demands high inter-annotator agreement and theory-independent categories, while the categories in hermeneutic reasoning are often tied to a particular interpretive approach (viz. a theory of literary interpretation) and may bear a non-trivial relation to a reader's pre-understanding. Building a comprehensive methodological framework that helps overcome these issues requires considerable time and patience. The established computational methodology has to be gradually opened up to more hermeneutically oriented research questions; resources and tools for the relevant categories of analysis have to be constructed. This article does not call into question that well-targeted efforts along this path are worthwhile. Yet, it makes the following additional programmatic point regarding directions for future research: It might be fruitful to explore—in parallel—the potential lying in DH-specific variants of the concept of rapid prototyping from Software Engineering. To get an idea of how computational analysis of some aspect of text might contribute to a hermeneutic research question, a prototypical analysis model is constructed, e.g., from related data collections and analysis categories, using transfer techniques. While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively. The first scenario illustrates the transfer of complex analysis pipelines across corpora; the second one addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions in literary text.

The study crosses disciplinary boundaries by bringing together linguistics and journalism studies. More specifically, it examines reporting about ""Australia Day""—the official national day of Australia, which is set on a date that is becoming increasingly controversial, as it marks the beginning of colonisation. Importantly, the article utilises digital technologies (computer-based text analysis and visualisation of word co-occurrence) to apply and test these methods for the analysis of news values in English-language reporting. The study findings will thus have broader implications for journalism research. These methods (e.g., word frequency, collocation, concordancing) have been used in corpus linguistics and other areas of the digital humanities, including in the analysis of journalistic texts, but most often with a focus on language practices or discourses. Our study demonstrates that journalism research can profit from the use of free and user-friendly tools such as the ones that are applied in this study. Beyond this methodological innovation, the study will contribute new insights to research on news values in national day reporting.

Through a reflexive process of ingesting data, probing for fruitful research questions, and considering how a deep map might be used by different audiences, we created a wireframe model of a deep map and explored how it related to spatial narratives. We explored the tension between interfaces for exploratory and structured views of data and sources, and devised a model for the intersections between spatial narratives and deep maps. The process of creating wireframes and prototype screens-and more importantly, the discussions and debates they initiated-helped us understand the complex requirements for deep maps and showed how a deep map can support a humanistic interpretation of the role of space in historical processes.

We currently face the challenge of the development of reading strategies that oscillate between 'close' and 'distant' reading. For years, these reading strategies have been a topic of debate between practitioners of Digital Humanities on the one hand, and 'traditional' humanists on the other. This ongoing polemics presents reading methods in an unnecessarily polarized manner. I argue that creativity research can be operationalized to come to a more productive model to characterize the ways we read in an information age. I show that the 'schism' between close and distant reading is structured around a number of apparent paradoxes that I unravel such as hyper‐ and deep attention/attention and distraction, and convergence and divergence. The paradox of creativity resides in the fact that we find convergence in divergence and vice versa, that the two by definition intertwine. Building on these concepts, I propose a model that considers reading in terms of scale variance. I suggest the humanities turn to creativity research and the interrelations between divergent‐exploratory and convergent‐integrative thinking (Lubart), for a conceptual framework that will allow us to train students on all levels how to read (and how and when not to read), in an information age.

Since its launch in September 2010, over 2.6 million words have been transcribed by volunteers. This paper will examine Transcribe Bentham's contribution to humanities research and the burgeoning field of digital humanities. It will then discuss the potential for the project's volunteers to make significant new discoveries among the vast Bentham Papers collection, and examine several examples of interesting material transcribed by volunteers thus far. We demonstrate here that a crowd-sourced initiative such as Transcribe Bentham can open up activities that were traditionally viewed as academic endeavors to a wider audience interested in history, whilst uncovering new, important historical primary source material. In addition, we see this as a switch in focus for those involved in digital humanities, highlighting the possibilities in using online and social media technologies for user engagement and participation in cultural heritage.

Nevertheless, it is more than important to grapple with present times and bring out the topics that can engage understanding of present discourses, potentials, and possibilities. It is even more true with art and humanities that, each on its side, faced significant challenges from the rise of technology-driven reality. As for the art, it seems that technology gives more opportunities and options than ever, but it is not without questions of value, authenticity, ownership, commodification, or artivist practices. As for the humanities, they already faced the alleged ""crisis"" due to the new wave of technocracy. New technology offers new media, new languages, and new discourses. But is it all good news? Should art and humanities form a kind of a (trans)tactical (im)pact and adopt the technology language, or would such a turn create more slippery points than easy-going practices? This paper will try to examine transdisciplinary and transtechnological coordinates of art and humanities taking the case study of cryptoart and blockchain system usage in contemporary artistic practices. This will also engage the discussion about digital humanities, which might be one of the next transdisciplinary steps to continue the fierce line of experimentation, and to combat the trend of going back to disciplinary frameworks.

However, cultural heritage is only ever partially preserved if its context is lost. This contribution argues that the future of conservation should include context as an integral and inalienable part of all forms of cultural heritage. As such, this will require an increase in cross-disciplinary collaborations with, among others, archaeologists, historians and archivists involved in efforts aimed at restoring cultural heritage to the contexts from which it has become disengaged. Based on theoretical frameworks from the digital humanities, cultural theory, history of the built environment and archaeology, the authors outline a method of re-contextualisation using the drowned landscape of Nubia as a case study. Aside from the landscape in which the Nubian monuments once stood and the vernacular of historical Nubian cultures, we argue that the history and socio-political nature of the decisions made in the name of preservation itself should also be incorporated as part of this context. The contribution argues that digital representations coupled with digital archiving provides one means of incorporating such heterogeneous and diverse information to present the contexts in which descriptions, texts, photographs, letters, videos and oral history can be better understood, interpreted and distributed.

Aparte de incluir, como parte de este contexto, el paisaje en el que antiguamente se encontraban los monumentos de Nubia y las culturas históricas vernáculas de Nubia, argumentamos que la historia y la naturaleza sociopolítica de las decisiones tomadas en nombre de la preservación misma también deberían ser incluidas. Se argumenta que las representaciones digitales junto con el archivo digital, proporcionan un medio de incorporar información heterogénea y diversa y así, presentar los contextos en los que se pueden entender, interpretar y distribuir mejor las descripciones, los textos, las fotografías, las cartas, los vídeos y la historia oral.

Trotzdem ist Kulturgut immer nur teilweise erhalten, wenn der Kontext verloren geht. Dieser Beitrag argumentiert, dass die Zukunft von Bestandserhaltung in der Erhaltung des Kontext als ein integrer und unveräußerlicher Bestandteil eines jeden Kulturguts liegt. Das würde dann eine Verstärkung der interdisziplinären Zusammenarbeit unter anderem mit Archäologen, Historikern und Archivaren, die an den Bemühungen beteiligt sind den Kontext des Kulturgutes wiederherzustellen, von dem es getrennt worden ist, notwendig machen. Die Autoren skizzieren eine Methode der Re-kontextualisierung basierend auf theoretischen Grundlagen aus den digitalen Geisteswissenschaften, Kulturtheorie, Archäologie und Bebauungsgeschichte, mit den „ertrunkenen"" Landschaften Nubiens als Fallbeispiel. Wir argumentieren, dass, abgesehen von der Landschaft, in der die nubischen Monumente einst gestanden haben und den einheimischen historischen nubischen Kulturen, die Geschichte und sozial-politische Natur der Entscheidungen, die im Namen der Erhaltung selbst getroffen wurden, auch als Teil des Kontextes verstanden werden sollten. Dieser Beitrag vertritt die Meinung, dass digitale Repräsentation verbunden mit digitaler Archivierung einen Weg bietet, heterogene und diverse Informationen zu verbinden um den Kontext für ein besseres Verständnis von Beschreibungen, Texten, Fotografien, Briefen, Videos und mündlicher Überlieferung zu bieten, sie zu interpretieren und zu verbreiten.

Furthermore, while one might allow that a too parochial or nationalist interpretation ultimately would short-change Heaney's contribution, I find it hard to agree that this is the sole - or perhaps even the most pressing - challenge to Heaney's reputation. While Heaney is a remarkable poet of home, marriage, and family, and his consistent focus upon these themes can be read, in part at least, as salutary symptoms of a twentieth-century redefinition of masculinity, his poetry does of course have many other virtues.

With a rhetorical analysis of the design features and curation processes of the CR/10 website, this article discusses the functions of CR/10 as a Warburgian memory atlas that shape the nonlinear, multifaceted narratives of a historical incident. Alongside this rhetorical analysis, I also conducted three sets of user experience studies with over thirty participants both within and outside the academy, including an ethnographic conference observation, a virtual ethnography of an online book group, and several semi-structured interviews, to examine CR/10's usability and propose new design opportunities to empower the interface. This article offers a strong case for the datafication of cultural memories and contributes to digital archives and humanities interface design with an innovative theoretical lens.

The project centres choreographer Katherine Dunham's transnational circulation, and takes a critical mixed methods approach informed by feminist and anti-racist discussions in the digital humanities in order to explore the questions and problems that make data analysis and visualization meaningful for dance history. Dunham's Data sits on robust datasets that we have manually curated from currently undigitized sources – an iterative and evaluative process that approaches these archives and the histories that they contain from a granular perspective. This update contextualizes our particular conjunction of archival and digital methods within dance history's precedents for curating data, and talks through our own datasets as tools for dance historical analysis in terms of Dunham's global legacy.

With the recent advances in interoperability between point cloud data and Building Information Modelling (BIM), digital heritage researchers have introduced the Heritage/Historic Information Modelling (HBIM) notion to the field. As heritage data require safeguarding strategies to ensure their sustainability, the process is closely tied to conservation actions in the architectural conservation field. Focusing on the intersection of the ongoing trends in HBIM research and the global needs for heritage conservation actions, this paper tackles methodological pipelines for the data-driven management of archaeological heritage places. It illustrates how HBIM discourse could be beneficial for easing valuebased decision-making in the conservation process. It introduces digital data-driven conservation actions by implementing a novel methodology for ancient building remains in Erythrae archaeological site (Turkey). The research ranges from a) surveying the in-situ remains and surrounding stones of the Heroon remains with digital photogrammetry and terrestrial laser scanning to b) designing a database system for building archaeology. The workflow offers high geometric fidelity and management of non-geometric heritage data by testing out the suitability and feasibility for the study of material culture and the physical assessment of archaeological building remains. This methodology is a fully data-enriched NURBS-based (non-uniform rational basis spline) three-dimensional (3D) model--which is integrated and operational in the BIM environment--for the holistic conservation process. Using a state-of-the-art digital heritage approach can be applied from raw data (initial stages) to decision-making about an archaeological heritage site (final stages). In conclusion, the paper offers a method for data-driven conservation actions, and given its methodological framework, it lends itself particularly well to HBIM-related solutions for building archaeology. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Las herramientas topográficas digitales proporcionan una representación geométrica muy exacta de sitios patrimoniales en forma de datos (nubes de puntos). Con los avances recientes de interoperabilidad entre nubes de puntos y modelado de información de la construcción (BIM), los investigadores en patrimonio digital han introducido la noción de modelado de información de la construcción patrimonial/histórica (HBIM) en este campo. Como los datos patrimoniales requieren estrategias de salvaguardia que garanticen su sostenibilibidad, el proceso está íntimamente ligado a acciones de conservación en el campo de la conservación arquitectónica. Teniendo en cuenta las últimas tendencias en investigación HBIM y las necesidades globales de las acciones de conservación patrimonial, este artículo afronta el flujo metodológico de la gestión basada en datos de sitios patrimoniales arqueológicos. Se introducen acciones de conservación basadas en datos que implementan una metodología novedosa en los restos edificados del sitio arqueológico de Erythrae (Turquía). La investigación aborda tanto la fase desde a) el topografiado in situ de los restos y las piedras circundantes de los restos de Heroon con fotogrametría digital y escaneado láser terrestre, hasta b) la fase del diseño del sistema de bases de datos en arqueología de la arquitectura. El flujo de trabajo ofrece alta fidelidad geométrica y de gestión de datos patrimoniales no geométricos; también prueba la idoneidad y viabilidad de cara al estudio de la cultura material y a la evaluación física de los restos de edificios arqueológicos. El modelo tridimensional (3D) enriquecido con datos basados en NURBS ('non-uniform rational B-splines'), se demuestra que es operativo en el proceso de conservación integral; este trata desde los datos sin procesar hasta la toma de decisiones sobre un sitio arqueológico-patrimonial, utilizando un procedimiento digital puntero. En conclusión, el artículo presenta un método orientado a acciones de conservación basadas en datos y, dado su marco metodológico, se presta particularmente bien a soluciones relacionadas con HBIM en arqueología de la arquitectura.

Using the metaphor of decomposition, successful collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars can be seen to require a reflexive scrutiny - a decomposition - of the disciplinary research processes that are involved, thus allowing crucial differences with respect to typical ways of posing research questions, the role of data, and the rhythm of the research process to be highlighted. It is argued that the currently popular expectation towards data as a self-identical organizational unit tends to downplay the role of decomposition as practice and process. A European cyberinfrastructure initiative that tries to respect the specificities of scholarly practice in the humanities is critically assessed, reflecting in particular on the inherent tension between 'mutual shaping' of digital tools and their users on the one hand, and the policy interest in efficient, functionalist design principles on the other.

We chose this user group, despite their incredibly domain-specific praxis, since the data challenges they face while doing digital humanities work are representative of the wider community. Our goal is to rethink how librarians can best assist researchers within a digital humanities (DH)-centered environment. This article first explores how data are conceived in the DH context and what insights can be drawn for data management. Next, focus shifts to the key characteristics of data collection and postprocessing activities carried out by manuscript scholars during repository visits. Parallels are drawn between manuscript scholar practices and those of other humanities disciplines. Finally, the implications for information professionals are explored and best practices for assisting digital humanists defined. In particular, community engagement in the process is stressed throughout, as it is the authors’ belief that it is necessary for success. The best practices are in no way exhaustive, and they are intended to be broadly applicable to a range of disciplines within the digital humanities and to librarians. Future work will involve validating a new data management approach informed by this study by testing in the field.

Analysis: The features of DAMS are evaluated to identify the ways in which they can currently meet researcher needs, and to suggest areas where further development is necessary. Conclusion and implications: Fedora-based DAMS hold great promise as the basis of digital humanities research platforms. Mature functionality is available for identity management, file and metadata management, versioning, publishing, social media sharing, discovery, interoperability, and long-term preservation. Further development is necessary in order to incorporate annotation, mark-up, and text analysis tools.

The process was experimental and had mixed results, as this article documents. The class provided an opportunity for undergraduate students from any discipline to work with objects and primary materials, requiring them to evaluate different sources of information, value, and legitimacy. Learning outcomes were nontraditional and intentionally underscripted. The collaborative and hands-on approaches toward digitization that de-emphasized the authority of the instructor were unsettling to some students.

The authors analysed 45 articles in order to draw a picture of research in this area. In the first phase, the articles were classified, and relevant quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results showed that three clear strands of research do exist: Digital Libraries, Networked Scholarship and Digital Humanities. Moreover, researchers involved in this research area tackle the problems related to technological uptake in the scholar’s profession from different points of view, and define the field in different—often complementary—ways, thus generating the perception of a research area still in need of a unifying vision. In the second phase, authors searched for evidence of the disciplinary contributions and interdisciplinary cohesion of research carried out in this area through the use of bibliometric maps. Results suggest that the area of Digital Scholarship, still in its infancy, is advancing in a rather fragmented way, shaping itself around the above-mentioned strands, each with its own research agenda. However, results from the cross-citation analysis suggest that the Networked Scholarship strand is more cohesive than the others in terms of cross-citations.

This process has also been accelerated by the emergence of cultural portals including regional, national and thematic portals and the European cultural portal Europeana. The Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) sector also has the challenge of the complexity of the information itself. This is because of the relationship that each cultural object has with the collections it is part of, with the memory institutions where it is held, with the other objects of the same nature and/or culturally connected with it, and the many other types of relationships that represent the real scientific value of the digitised cultural object (be it a book, an archival record, an artefact from a museum, a sound recording or a video). Further, the investment in the production of the digital cultural heritage data is extremely high because the description of each object requires the human intervention of experts in the sector in order to associate the necessary metadata. Automatic extraction of knowledge (metadata) from the digital representation of cultural items is still far from being at a production level. It is not yet commonly available or seamless to the cultural institutions that are engaged in the digitisation of their collections. In addition to the DCH content that derive from digitisation processes applied to the tangible heritage, also born digital cultural heritage is more and more a reality, particularly in the artistic scenario. Plastic artists are commonly using 3D modelling for their studies. Architects, writers, multimedia artists, graphic designers and almost all other artistic expressions produce data that need to be preserved for the researchers of today and for the future generations. Digital cultural data is therefore extremely precious and its preservation is more and more an imperative priority. This paper intends to discuss these matters in the light of the ongoing work carried out by the DCH-RP project () funded by the European Commission.

The two can work complementarily—so closely, in fact, that it sometimes becomes difficult to know which of the two one is practicing at any given moment. Multiple skill sets need not define the historian as being a particular 'kind': They just enable any historian to do his or her work more completely than before.

However, the conditions of abundant data typical of digital humanities tend to relax the constraints of tests of significance and to allow greater freedom to try out alternative interpretations within the frame of a single study. At the same time, the elusiveness of rigorous standardization within a very large database, especially if it stretches over wide spaces or many decades, may be seen to demand meticulous source criticism of a sort that has more often been associated with the humanities than with quantitative science. There is even a tendency for the data itself to drift away from its usual function as a means of research and to become itself an object of study, inspiring reflection on how the tools and concepts of a field like psychology may be evolving in response to new constraints or ambitions.

They are, along with museums, archives, theaters, cinemas, nowadays, as well as throughout the history, active agents of intercultural and interethnic communication. Primarily due to their general ethical and aesthetic values, characteristics of particular cultures that they are profiling, and then due to the standardized professional peculiarities that allow permeation of library science with other disciplines, as well as horizontal connectivity within the profession in the interest of the nation and its culture.

This survey of projects demonstrates how the work of Renaissance studies faculty and graduate students in Canada is increasing accessibility to sources, creating new knowledge environments and spaces for collaboration, and encouraging new ways to map and visualize Renaissance data, with an end result that enhances our understanding of the past and the ways that digital technology is changing humanities scholarship. The article also suggests that from the perspective of graduate students, participation in these endeavours provides not only training in digital technologies but also the opportunity to contribute knowledge to the field in concrete ways and the chance to establish a foundation in methodologies and practices that will shape approaches to Renaissance studies research and teaching in the future. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Cet article se penche sur les humanités numériques et les études de la Renaissance au Canada, en présentant des projets établis tels qu'Iter et plus récents tels que Serai, ainsi qu'en examinant l'intérêt plus récent pour le système d 'information géographique (SIG) historique. Ce survol de différents projets montre comment le travail de professeurs et d'étudiants aux études supérieures dans le domaine améliore l'accès aux sources, créent des environnements pour de nouvelles connaissances et des espaces de collaboration, et favorisent de nouvelles façons de visualiser des données relatives à la Renaissance, enrichissant ainsi notre compréhension du passé, tout en mettant en lumière les transformations des sciences humaines provoquées par les technologies numériques. Cet article avance également qu'en ce qui concerne les étudiants aux études supérieures, la participation dans ces projets non seulement leur donne de l'expérience en humanités numériques, mais leur donne aussi la chance de pouvoir contribuer de façon concrète à l'avancement des connaissances dans leur domaine. Ces expériences leur donne également l'opportunité de développer une méthode et des pratiques qui détermineront leurs approches dans leur recherche et leur enseignement à venir en études de la Renaissance.

Each of the commentators approached the topic through their own lens—Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4 themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship between 'thick descriptions' and 'thin' digital ones, and finally, the role of digital history as a type of a 'trading creole' between scientists working in quantified disciplines like scientific psychology and less quantified ones like history. I think the commentators have rightly observed some pitfalls in the uncritical application of digital history. On the other hand, in my response, I argue that the careful use of digital methods, where the user stays in communication with nondigital historians, opens new perspectives for historians of science, historians of psychology, and psychologists themselves. Digital methods are not there to supplant historicist work but to add to it and translate it to new audiences.

Many libraries have built digital humanities scholarly commons, but it is rare in China's libraries. Through literature and website research, digital humanities database construction practice, questionnaires, and interviews with humanities scholars, we explore the path to build digital humanities scholarly commons at Beijing Normal University Library. We constructed an educators' prosopography database, collected database construction suggestions from humanities scholars, and assessed their willingness to construct a digital humanities commons with us. Combined with the feedback, we found that humanities researchers are interested in digital humanities methods, but they need relevant tools training. Beijing Normal University Library can provide humanities scholars with training workshops on digital humanities concepts, methods, tools, platforms, and database construction, and the library is good at full-cycle data service including data collection, management, storage, and publishing. The library should strengthen data mining, text analysis, and visualization in the digital humanities study, focus on the authority and reliability of data, cooperate with humanities scholars to collect and verify data, and then enhance the library's influence in the academic community.

The preceding article articulated the need to move beyond the mapping of literary texts onto geographic sites in the world and into the mapping of space relationally in nonreferential ways by means of literary topology. This second article seeks to make a larger case for new ways of working in the digital humanities and suggests that new methods of analysis and new tools are needed. It articulates an integrated visual–verbal method of interpretation that combines the close reading of spatial meanings and structures within a text with analysis of the map series generated out of that same text in an iterative structure. It also argues for the value of layers of mapping and of comparative mapping of the same place both referentially and nonreferentially. The literary texts chosen to exemplify the method are Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There. These allow us to explore the validity of the claims made. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Cet article est le second de deux textes interdépendants qui présentent de nouvelles façons de cartographier la littérature au moyen d'outils numériques adaptés au XXIe siècle. Le premier article exposait la nécessité de dépasser la cartographie des textes littéraires en fonction des sites géographiques du monde réel et d'adopter, au moyen d'une topologie littéraire, une cartographie relationnelle de l'espace qui soit non référentielle. Cet article-ci cherche à trouver des débouchés pour les nouvelles méthodes de travail en sciences humaines numériques ; l'idée y est avancée que de nouvelles méthodes d'analyse et de nouveaux outils sont nécessaires. Il propose une méthode d'interprétation visuelle-verbale intégrée, qui allie la lecture attentive des significations et des structures spatiales au sein d'un texte à l'analyse de la série de cartes générée par ce même texte dans une structure itérative. Il défend par ailleurs la valeur des couches de la cartographie et de la cartographie comparative d'un même lieu de manière référentielle et non référentielle. Les œuvres littéraires choisies pour illustrer la méthode sont le Frankenstein de Mary Shelley et Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (De l'autre côté du miroir) de Lewis Carroll. Elles nous permettent d'explorer la validité de nos hypothèses.

Local private documents are crucial sources for studying the social and economic history of early modern China. In the database project, metadata creation and database development are under the direction of historical philology, and the metadata elements—type, guihu, administrative units—are defined by historical philology. The database structure successfully copes with the heterogeneous sources of local private documents. Text mining tools developed by librarians allow historians to explore social networks, trade types, and contract formats in socioeconomic history.

Locating vast swathes of data in a country renowned for its renewable energy has prompted a series of questions about the nature of the relationship between these two actors. Our ethnographic interest resides in analysing how, and why, Denmark is rapidly becoming Europe's primary US data centre location, and in exploring the transformative processes through which the Danish state is being reconfigured as digital. In doing so, we emphasise the role of infrastructures in digital state-making and draw upon a particular reading of anthropological exchange theory to conceptualise how the state is being reconstituted through exchange practices with data centre actors. We argue that as Big-Tech territorialises state land and resources, the state in turn reterritorializes the promising digital futures that come with Big-Tech, making visible its new digital frontier.

Despite this fact, automatic processing of Swiss German is still a considerable challenge due to the fact that it is mostly a spoken variety and that it is subject to considerable regional variation. This paper presents the ArchiMob corpus, a freely available general-purpose corpus of spoken Swiss German based on oral history interviews. The corpus is a result of a long design process, intensive manual work and specially adapted computational processing. We first present the modalities of access of the corpus for linguistic, historic and computational research. We then describe how the documents were transcribed, segmented and aligned with the sound source. This work involved a series of experiments that have led to automatically annotated normalisation and part-of-speech tagging layers. Finally, we present several case studies to motivate the use of the corpus for digital humanities in general and for dialectology in particular.

We layer these images with a published, geo-referenced collection of Land Survey Maps of China (1903–1948), which includes the earliest large-scale maps of major cities and regions in China that are produced with modern cartographic techniques. By bringing together historical illustrations depicting spatial configurations of localities and the earliest modern cartographic maps, researchers of Chinese history can study the different spatial epistemologies represented in both collections. We report our workflow for creating this web GIS platform, starting from identifying and extracting visual materials from local gazetteers, tagging them with keywords and categories to facilitate content search, to georeferencing them based on their source locations. We also experimented with neural networks to train a tagger with positive results. Finally, we display them in the web GIS platform with two modes, Images in Map (IIM) and Maps in Map (MIM), and with content- and location-based filtering. These features together enable researchers easy and quick exploration and comparison of these two large sets of geospatial and visual materials of China.

The main method applied is a computational textual analysis of press articles based on frequency, correlations and co-occurrences. The purpose is to map the topics of the examined articles in the context of relations between Poland and the two Koreas in various areas, predominantly political and economic relations. Emphasis is placed on the impact the carmaker Daewoo's investment in Poland in the mid-1990s had on bilateral Polish-South Korean relations. First, the authors argue that Korean issues in the Polish press, mainly in the second half of the 1990s, particularly concerned economic affairs. Secondly, they argue that after Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004, the country's interest in the two Koreas decreased, and since that time has remained at a more or less constant level. Finally, the authors discuss the outcome of the research in the context of the main developments in Polish-Korean relations, taking into consideration the results of a Polish public opinion survey presenting the international linkages between national public opinion and foreign policy.

"Embracing New Trends in Scholarly Communication: From Competency Requirements in the Workplace to LIS Curriculum Presence.","Raju, Jaya","Journal of Librarianship & Scholarly Communication",="21623309",,="2019","7","1","1","25","141483946","10.7710/2162-3309.2291","Iowa State University Library","Article","Academic libraries; South Africa; Libraries and Archives; Communication in learning & scholarship; Scientific communication; Digital humanities; Work environment",,"INTRODUCTION Scholarly communication has undergone dramatic change in the digital era as a result of rapidly evolving digital technology. It is within this context of evolving scholarly communication that this paper reports on an inquiry into (1) the extent to which university libraries in South Africa are actively embracing new and emerging trends in scholarly communication; and (2), the extent to which LIS school curricula in South Africa are responding to new and emerging scholarly communication competencies required in university libraries. METHODS This qualitative study, located within an interpretivist epistemological worldview, was informed by the Operational Elements of Scientific Communication aspect of Khosrowjerdi's (2011) Viable Scientific Communication Model. Data was collected using summative content analysis of university library job advertisements over a four-year period; South African university libraries' organizational organograms; and course descriptions available on the websites of South Africa's LIS schools. RESULTS & DISCUSSION A review of job advertisements and organograms shows that on the whole university libraries in South Africa are embracing the new and emerging trends in scholarly communication, but some university libraries are performing better than others in adopting emerging scholarly communication services such as RDM, digital humanities, or research landscape analysis. Course description analysis provides evidence that LIS schools' curricula, as per global trend reported in the literature, do not seem to be keeping pace with developments in scholarly communication. CONCLUSION The ambivalent nature of an evolving scholarly communications field with unclear definitions and boundaries necessitates professional practitioners who are adaptable and open to change as well as an LIS education curriculum that is in constant review to seamlessly embrace an evolving field propelled by advancing digital technologies.

"Embracing New Trends in Scholarly Communication: From Competency Requirements in the Workplace to LIS Curriculum Presence.","Raju, Jaya","Journal of Librarianship & Scholarly Communication",="21623309",,="2019","7","1","1","25","141483946","10.7710/2162-3309.2291","Iowa State University Library","Article","Academic libraries; South Africa; Communication in learning & scholarship; Scientific communication; Digital humanities; Work environment",,"INTRODUCTION Scholarly communication has undergone dramatic change in the digital era as a result of rapidly evolving digital technology. It is within this context of evolving scholarly communication that this paper reports on an inquiry into (1) the extent to which university libraries in South Africa are actively embracing new and emerging trends in scholarly communication; and (2), the extent to which LIS school curricula in South Africa are responding to new and emerging scholarly communication competencies required in university libraries. METHODS This qualitative study, located within an interpretivist epistemological worldview, was informed by the Operational Elements of Scientific Communication aspect of Khosrowjerdi's (2011) Viable Scientific Communication Model. Data was collected using summative content analysis of university library job advertisements over a four-year period; South African university libraries' organizational organograms; and course descriptions available on the websites of South Africa's LIS schools. RESULTS & DISCUSSION A review of job advertisements and organograms shows that on the whole university libraries in South Africa are embracing the new and emerging trends in scholarly communication, but some university libraries are performing better than others in adopting emerging scholarly communication services such as RDM, digital humanities, or research landscape analysis. Course description analysis provides evidence that LIS schools' curricula, as per global trend reported in the literature, do not seem to be keeping pace with developments in scholarly communication. CONCLUSION The ambivalent nature of an evolving scholarly communications field with unclear definitions and boundaries necessitates professional practitioners who are adaptable and open to change as well as an LIS education curriculum that is in constant review to seamlessly embrace an evolving field propelled by advancing digital technologies.

Popular online nationalism in the People's Republic of China (PRC) is a case in point: In the PRC, digital nationalism has become a central feature of political discourse and decision‐making, at times powerfully shaping the state's policy efforts. This article explores a missing puzzle piece in how state‐led and popular nationalism interact in Chinese politics: the role that advanced information and communication technologies play in such processes. This is a question that is not only relevant to scholars of China but also to anyone interested in the role that digital media and communication play in the formation and spread of contemporary nationalism. How do interactions in complex sociotechnical systems affect nationalism today? To answer this question, the article analyses and traces interaction and feedback loops in Chinese digital environments during Sino‐Japanese disputes over the East China Sea. It shows how the interactions between humans, organisations and technologies create unexpected variations in outcome that resonate through China's internet and create the conditions from which digital nationalism can powerfully emerge to shape legitimation and policy‐making processes.

Scribe data have proved essential for creating statistical and comparative analyses, compositional analyses and producing online thematic indices for the Medieval Music Database over a large body of music. Even though the Scribe still functions in cross-platform DOS-emulated computer environments, the growth of Digital Humanities, linked open data and enormous potential for online research collaboration offers a series of opportunities for encoded medieval music notation data. This report details the authors’ efforts since 2013 in converting Scribe’s data into open access data based upon the standard being developed by the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI). When coupled with recent developments in the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) project, our new Scribe-based module, known as NeoScribe, offers significant enhancements to the MEI standard that stand to benefit current and future developments in digital musicology.

The traditional ways of garden trimming requiring manual labor are becoming obsolete and electric trimmers are extensively being used in maintenance of gardens. While carrying out trimming activity with electric hedge trimmer, operator undergoes various awkward posture(s) resulting into musculoskeletal disorders. The present study is undertaken to evaluate existing electric hedge trimmer workstation and suggest suitable modifications in order to reduce drudgery. The study uses anthropometric data from the literature for the user population for modeling of manikin. The concept of digital human manikin (DHM) is used for modeling and simulation purpose. Here DHM tools in CATIA software such as Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), carry analysis and biomechanics analysis are used for the analysis. Study presents ergonomic evaluation of farm worker(s) in Maharashtra state of India operating electric hedge trimmer. RULA score of 6-7 showed that existing electric hedge trimmer workstation is not safe for workers and must be changed soon or immediately. However, carry analysis depicted that existing weight of trimmer is acceptable. Biomechanics single action analysis showed considerable values of moments and forces coming on the various joints and body parts. The study suggested new improved workstation for the electric hedge trimming operation on the basis of the RULA and biomechanics analysis. The improved workstation not only reduced RULA score to acceptable limit but also significantly reduced values of moments and forces coming on the body of worker. Thus, the study explored the potential of DHM technique in the product design, especially in ergonomic design of new workstations or to improve existing workstations.

Through our methodological approach, we will study the impact of EU Studies on the eastern border of the European Union, our research sample targeting 6 European countries, of which 3 are EU members and 3 are non-EU members, and a total of 15 universities. The main research directions that we will examine in the target universities will refer to the disciplines with European themes that are found in the university study programs, focusing on the nine major fields agreed by the European Commission. The research methodology will focus on the method of content analysis of official, public, digital and non-digital documents, with which we will identify a series of indicators: number of European disciplines, EU Studies Curriculum, Study Programmes, courses addressing Border Studies, and based on them, we shall make a series of interpretations. The main objective of the research, is in the first phase to carry out an evaluation of the European-themed courses that are found at the level of the 15 target universities, so that we can visualize the degree of attention that universities pay, in order to offer solutions, examples of good practice, to develop the implementation of European courses in university study programs.

Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to implement a hypothetical collaborative annotation system (CAS) that uses information visualisation and visual analytics techniques to leverage the cognitive effort implied by these tasks. To identify user needs and other requirements, we held two user-driven design experiences with DH experts and lay users, focusing on the annotation of uncertainty in historical recipes and literary texts. The lessons learned from these experiments are gathered in a series of insights and observations on how these different user groups collaborated to adapt an uncertainty taxonomy to solve the proposed exercises. Furthermore, we extract a series of recommendations and future lines of work that we share with the community in an attempt to establish a common agenda of DH research that focuses on collaboration around the idea of uncertainty.

The case studies presented cover a range of undergraduate research projects that incorporated active and inquiry-based learning exercises with digital archives as a pedagogical approach to digital humanities instruction. The research projects include an honors project to create an online exhibit of medieval manuscript leaves, a capstone experience in the library to explore the relationship between archives and social justice, and a course project that used the University Archives to research the University of Scranton's Black history.

We therefore seek to establish a concept of explanatory annotation that is reader-oriented and combines hermeneutics with the opportunities provided by digital methods. In a first step, we are going to present a few examples of existing annotations that apparently do not take into account readerly needs. To us, they represent seven types of common problems in explanatory annotation. We then introduce a possible model of best practice which is based on categories and structured along the lines of the following questions: What kind(s) of annotations do improve text comprehension? Which contexts must be considered when annotating? Is it possible to develop a concept of the reader on the basis of annotations-and can, in turn, annotations address a particular kind of readership, i.e.: in how far can annotations be(come) individualised?

This article examines five case studies that exemplify how academic librarians have collaborated with faculty on research initiatives and provided instructional expertise in support of digital humanities research utilizing text encoding and the application of the Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines. The analysis of the case studies will examine the strategies and outcomes of academic librarians' work to promote broader exposure of text encoding to students and scholars entering digital humanities scholarship. The study then draws upon the work of Etienne Wenger and Jean Lave on communities of practice to consider how the research collaborations and training initiatives presented in the case studies reveal ways in which librarians can facilitate the ability of scholars to become members of communities of practice within digital humanities.

The bibliometric approach of this digital humanities project uses book sale catalogues to study the circulation of books and ideas in eighteenth-century Europe. This article analyses the catalogue of Koerten, her background and professional interests, the 'femininity' of female book collections in general, and the problems and opportunities one faces when using bibliometric data on book sale catalogues.

The corpus was extracted from 1,269 journals indexed by PsycINFO. The data in our analysis consisted of the relevant terms mined from the titles and abstracts of all of the articles in the corpus. Based on the co-occurrences of these terms, we developed a series of chronological visualizations using a bibliometric software tool called VOSviewer. These visualizations produced a stable structure through the 5 decades under analysis, and this structure was analyzed as a data-mined proxy for the disciplinary formation of scientific psychology in the second part of the 20th century. Considering the stable structure uncovered by our term co-occurrence analysis and its visualization, we discuss it in the context of Lee Cronbach's 'Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology' (1957) and conventional history of 20th-century psychology’s disciplinary formation and history of methods. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive digital humanities perspective on the large-scale structural development of research in English-language psychology from 1950 to 1999.

These examples only scratch the surface of the breadth of research communities that have benefited from close cooperation in the European Research Area. While each field developed discipline-specific services over the years, common themes can also be distinguished. All humanities RIs address, in varying degrees, questions around research data management, the use of standards and the desired interoperability of data across disciplinary boundaries. This article sheds light on how cluster project PARTHENOS developed pooled services and shared solutions for its audience of humanities researchers, RI managers and policymakers. In a time where the convergence of existing infrastructure is becoming ever more important – with the construction of a European Open Science Cloud as an audacious, ultimate goal – we hope that our experiences inform future work and provide inspiration on how to exploit synergies in interdisciplinary, transnational, scientific cooperation.

But what if we expand our conception of cinema to the numerous film experiences that happened beyond the commercial screen? This essay poses this question with the hope of initiating a transnational reinterpretation of silent film historiography through noncommercial cinema. I focus on two Catalan amateur filmmakers from the late 1920s and early 1930s, Lluís Gisbert and Llorenç Llobet Gràcia, , to show how silent film practices continued to develop beyond commercial cinema in the films, writings, and screening venues of amateurs throughout the world for decades after the release of the first talkies.

Historical research on World War II and the impact of large-scale violence largely depends on the availability of source materials: diaries, newspapers, eyewitness accounts, archival documents, photographs and videos, etc. Currently, these resources are held by a large number of memory institutions, often in analogue formats. For scholars, it can be challenging to find out which collections are relevant for their research and also what information can be found in these collections. In this article it is argued that Semantic Web technologies, together with new digital tooling to automatically open up collections and interlink their contents, have the potential to revolutionize future access and use. By making the contents of collections machine-readable and enriching them with links to reference data, a shift can be made from a ""web of documents"" to a ""web of data."" By publishing all contents as linked open data, domain experts in research infrastructures (RIs) and thematic aggregators (TAs) are enabled to add their own ""thematic"" layers to the data, thus empowering themselves and others to explore the data in new, more sophisticated ways. Since we are only at the start of this development, the author advocates a close cooperation between archives, libraries, and museums (ALMs) and domain experts.

Increases in computing power and data availability have seen a rise in individual researchers and research groups working on digital scholarship projects in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This article shows how publishers of traditional digital archives have adapted to the increasing prevalence of DH amongst their traditional customers. The success of this adaptation depends entirely on the relationship with the academic community, and Gale has seen a shift from being a provider of products to a partner, trusted to help libraries, scholars and institutions achieve their objectives. As a leading global provider of digital archives, Gale is well placed to review the current state of DH research and teaching, and this article will discuss significant academic events that have brought scholars, librarians and students together, and the lessons learned for institutions around the world looking to expand into DH. Finally, the article looks at how working to understand the common challenges and barriers to DH research and teaching has pushed many archive publishers to re-evaluate traditional archive publishing and enable new and innovative ways to explore the past.

The manuscript in question and the texts it carries show a complex, interwoven network of intra- and intertextual relations and the paper argues that only a combination, provided by computational means as the methodological key, of two usually distinct research approaches, namely close reading and distant reading, can deliver answers to the research questions imposed. The paper introduces some central methods of an interdisciplinary field, commonly known as digital humanities, in the realm of data representation (data modeling and text encoding) as well as core applications in the realm of data presentation and analysis (digital editing and visualization). As these supportive methods are neither the starting-point for historical research nor an end-in-itself, they are mirrored against scholarly practices of both, of the early Middle Ages and of modern scholarship.

Instead of a monograph and the presentation of the history as lineal narrative, the work of the historian could be produced as a video game. Not historical fiction that sacrifices history for story and not a video game that sacrifices history for gameplay, but a video game that presents original research rivaling any great work of history, transforming readers, learners, and viewers into players interacting with history. The video game offers far greater potential for the creation and presentation of history than any other entertainment or interactive media. Although computer and video games may seem to be far removed from the historical narrative, both examine and form points of view about how cultures, economies, polities, and societies function. Ignoring the realities of budget and hiring a game design team, this article will imagine how historical research could be presented as a scholarly game. To explore these issues, the article analyzes key game mechanics and narrative structure in the popular history-based video games: the Assassin's Creed series, the Total War series, Rockstar Games' L.A. Noire and Red Dead Redemption, and Paradox Interactive's Crusader Kings II and Europa Universalis. It also examines Tracy Fullerton's experimental game Walden. In addition, it explores how the game design process could be applied to developing a scholarly game.

Are Digital Humanities and World Literature establishing themselves as fields utilizing analytical tools that are at odds with the aims and perspectives of feminist literary history and reception history as a part of literary history? We argue that gender research and theory is insufficiently developed in both computational literary history and World Literature. An unproblematic understanding of translations, canonization, English as a global language, and the use of large-scale computational methods and formalized interpretive models is in many cases not beneficial for the understanding of texts by women writers or from feminist perspectives. Drawing on feminist criticism of computational methods and arguments for specialized rather than generalized knowledge about literary history, we propose that digitization in some form, be it a bibliographical database or digitization of a corpus of texts, may be thought of as part of the research process in projects oriented towards gender and cultural exchange.

Are Digital Humanities and World Literature establishing themselves as fields utilizing analytical tools that are at odds with the aims and perspectives of feminist literary history and reception history as a part of literary history? We argue that gender research and theory is insufficiently developed in both computational literary history and World Literature. An unproblematic understanding of translations, canonization, English as a global language, and the use of large-scale computational methods and formalized interpretive models is in many cases not beneficial for the understanding of texts by women writers or from feminist perspectives. Drawing on feminist criticism of computational methods and arguments for specialized rather than generalized knowledge about literary history, we propose that digitization in some form, be it a bibliographical database or digitization of a corpus of texts, may be thought of as part of the research process in projects oriented towards gender and cultural exchange.

However, there is still a shortage of user-friendly and easily accessible interfaces for various user groups, especially regarding collections based on text sources. After a brief introduction to the research area and the project, this paper discusses a visualization and design study based on a selection of digitized archival material from the Ernst von Glasersfeld estate. We present a conceptual outline of this work and examples concerning discourse mapping, the analysis of argumentative structures as well as some didactical approaches. In so doing, conceptual backgrounds, educational material and design principles are outlined. The paper concludes with critical considerations as regards the limitations of the approaches discussed.

Using an example drawn from the vast archives of post-war interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives – their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold – can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as 'near', 'next to', 'at the corner of' without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities.

It identifies the cohort among the refugee rabbis who were part of a communitisation process and defined themselves as 'the last generation of the German rabbinate', and illuminates how and why they could continue their careers in the United States better than elsewhere. It also examines their late returns to the country of their birth and analyses how they made sense of their own history by exchanges with the Germans. This was part of the transnational knowledge transfer that presented them as the last rabbis in the German-Jewish tradition, but also allowed them to successfully relaunch the establishment of modern Jewish seminaries for rabbinical training on the European continent and achieve symbolic continuity, eighty years after their destruction by Nazism.

However, basic advances in digital humanities, including digitization, multimedia projects, social media, and common online applications can fundamentally transform graduate student teaching in ways that are particularly useful for empire and colonial histories. Standard digitally infused practices have not yet been applied to facilitate radical changes in pedagogy. Digital methods can be used to enhance graduate cohorts by enabling a community of learners in and outside the classroom; expand the definition of scholarship to challenge traditional academic hierarchies; draw regular connections between global colonial processes; question the ethics of writing imperial histories; and shift assessment practices away from students' performance for the professor and toward individual self-reflection and communally defined standards. Together, these digitally enabled methods define scholars of colonialism far beyond their expertise in a specific historic field's scholarly canon.

In this particular field of development, 3D drawing and digital modelling are based on the application of new Scan-to-HBIM-to-VR specifications capable of transforming simple points (point clouds) into mathematical models and digital information. Thanks to the direct application of novel grades of generation (GOG) and accuracy (GOA) it has been possible to go beyond the creation of complex models for heritage BIM (HBIM) and explore the creation of informative 3D representation composed by subelements (granular HBIM objects) characterized by a further level of knowledge.

Historical maps are also a fundamental element of cultural heritage and digital humanities applications since they provide, as base maps, the picture of historical space on which other resources are projected and the names of the historical places, which permits the organization and geocoding of various information. Historical maps should be managed following a semantic approach that considers data models and standards from the different disciplines of cultural heritage and Digital humanities. In this spirit, this research extends previous efforts to implement an application profile for documenting historical maps based on the CIDOC model and to develop an annotated database of historical maps. This profile handles the concepts that define a map and the map's relationships with cultural objects, persons, events, and processes. For data creation and visualization, a Web application was developed using Arches, an open software platform for cultural heritage management that supports both CIDOC and geographical information standards.

Les cartes historiques sont aussi un élément fondamental des applications dédiées au patrimoine culturel et aux sciences humaines numériques puisqu'elles donnent, en tant que cartes de base, une image de l'espace historique sur laquelle sont projetées d'autres ressources et le nom des lieux historiques, ce qui permet d'organiser et de géocoder diverses informations. Les cartes historiques devraient être abordées selon une approche sémantique qui considère les modèles et les normes de données des différentes disciplines liées au patrimoine culturel et aux sciences humaines numériques. C'est dans cet esprit que notre recherche poursuit des travaux antérieurs consistant à élaborer un profil d'application pour documenter les cartes historiques à partir du modèle du CIDOC et créer une base de données annotée de cartes historiques. Ce profil tient compte des concepts définitionnels de la carte et de ses relations aux objets, aux personnes, aux évènements et aux processus culturels. En vue de rassembler ces données et de les visualiser, une application web a été conçue à partir d'Arches, plateforme logicielle à code source ouvert destinée à la gestion du patrimoine culturel et compatible à la fois avec les normes du CIDOC et celles de l'information géographique.

Corpus contents originate in the Ben-Yehuda Project, an open access repository of Hebrew literature online, and in digital images curated from the collections of the National Library of Israel, a selection of which have been transcribed through a dedicated crowdsourcing task that feeds back into the library's online catalog. Texts in the corpus are encoded following best practices in the digital humanities, including markup of metadata that enables time-sensitive research, linguistic and other, of the corpus. Evaluation of morphological analysis based on Modern Hebrew language models is shown to distinguish between genres in the historical variety, highlighting the importance of ephemeral materials for linguistic research and for potential collaboration with libraries and cultural institutions in the process of corpus creation. We demonstrate the use of the corpus in diachronic linguistic research and suggest ways in which the association it provides between digital images and texts can be used to support automatic language processing and to enhance resources in the digital humanities.

It demonstrates how historical perspectives can problematize and unsettle various automatisms that are widely present in journalistic, public, and policy discourses. Through examples from the Geo Archive, the article illustrates how unavoidable historical dimensions can enrich our understandings on the interaction between environmental issues and migration flows. This paper engages with an open access ""archive in-the-making"". This Geo Archive includes case studies of migration flows and puts those flows in conversation with environmental transformations and climatic changes. The analysed collection presents high-profile stories which are representative samples of different approaches, temporalities, geographies, sources of information, narratives, and scales. This endeavour encompasses different disciplines and fields of expertise: environmental humanities, IT and communication experts, and political ecology. The archive places itself within the realms of public history, environmental history, and history of the present and aims to reach out to wider audiences. This digital humanities project stemmed from a support action funded by the EU initiative Horizon 2020 titled CLISEL whose overarching goal was to analyse and better inform institutional responses and policies addressing climate refugees and migrants.

We tackle this information access problem from a geographic information science perspective using a case study exploring a semi-structured historical encyclopedia. We propose a three-pronged approach for this, based around (1) automatic retrieval of spatio-temporal and thematic information from digital text documents; (2) transformation of the extracted information to spatialize and visualize spatio-temporal and thematic structures; and (3) integration of the spatialized displays in an interactive web interface driven by a user-centered design and evaluation approach. We implemented an interactive spatialized network display to allow identification of spatio-temporal relationships hidden in the text archive, complemented by an interactive self-organizing map display to visualize thematic relationships in these text documents. We evaluated the utility and usability of the developed interface in a user study with digital humanities scholars. Empirical results show that the developed interface supports target users in the humanities uncovering latent spatio-temporal and thematic relationships and generated new insights through the spatialized text collection. Adopting this approach, we illustrate one avenue to addressing the information access problem in the digital humanities from a GIScience perspective.

After providing background information on both platforms, we apply co-word analysis and topic modeling to show thematic similarities and differences between the two sites, focusing particularly on how they frame DH as a new paradigm in humanities research. We encounter a much higher ratio of posts using humanities-related terms compared to their digital counterparts, suggesting a one-way dependency of digital humanities-related terms on the corresponding unprefixed labels. The results also show that the terms digital archive, digital literacy, and digital pedagogy are relatively independent from the respective unprefixed terms, and that digital publishing, digital libraries, and digital media show considerable cross-pollination between the specialization and the general noun. The topic modeling reproduces these findings and reveals further differences between the two platforms. Our findings also indicate local differences in how the emerging field of DH is conceptualized and show dynamic topical shifts inside these respective contexts.

At stake in this contradiction isn't just the relationship between digital enthusiasm and spatial theory (or the wider spatial turn), but the theoretical status of the visual itself in spatial scholarship. It raises a crucial question: how does visual material—everything from today's statistical maps and cutting‐edge data graphics to the broader use of primary‐source photographs or drawings—in fact shape our understanding of space, and what theoretical work does it do? By extension, how can humanists make critical theoretical interventions through their own visual production? This article proposes an analytic vocabulary of ""visual argument"" grounded in an image‐focused rereading of two canonical bodies of work: the neo‐Marxist theory most cited by spatial history (Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, Doreen Massey, and Edward Soja) and the conspicuously uncited work of Fernand Braudel. By focusing on how these authors' illustrations make claims about spatial subjectivity and the historicity of space—especially through visual relationships of background and foreground—I argue for a new way of understanding and responding to this work and to the visual project of spatial history today. A visual analysis highlights not only the limitations of neo‐Marxism but also the pervasiveness of certain assumptions—shared across the neo‐Marxists, Braudel, and digital visualization—about temporality, the natural/human dichotomy, and the methodological tensions between argument and visualization. I present my own mapping of Phoenix as one possibility for an argument‐driven rethinking of familiar visual commitments, which also suggests a broader meditation on the relationship between visual and textual scholarship.

Against the backdrop of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science about what models are and what they do, this paper presents a semiotic perspective on models in the framework of Charles S. Peirce's theory of signs that sheds light on the practice of modeling in the digital humanities. As a first step, it is argued that models are icons, i.e. signs that represent their specific objects by being regarded as similar to them; and that there are, in all, three basic types of model, namely ""images,"" ""diagrams,"" and ""metaphors."" A second step explicates relevant implications of this model-theoretic approach, especially as they relate to the digital humanities. In particular, it is shown that models are not identical to the things they represent and that they only represent them partially; that the representation operates on the basis of a mapping relation between select properties of the model and its object; that each model and each instance of modeling has a theoretical framework; and that models are the true basis for genuine creativity and progress in research.

I invite as scholars of the digital humanities to see in the region’s belief in incompleteness and the compositeness of being human, as well as in the capacity to be present everywhere at the same time an indication that we have much to learn from the past on how best to understand and harness current purportedly innovative advances in ICTs. The idea of digital technologies making it possible for humans and things to be present even in their absence and absent even in their presence is not that dissimilar to the belief in what is often labelled and dismissed as witchcraft and magic that lends itself to a world of infinite possibilities – a world of presence in simultaneous multiplicities and eternal powers to redefine reality. The article argues in favour of incompleteness as a normal way of being. It challenges students of humanity to envisage a relationship between humans and digital technologies that is founded less on dichotomies and binary oppositions, nor on zero-sum games of conquest and superiority. If humans are present in things and things in humans, thanks to the interconnections, the flexibility and fluidity of being that come with recognition of and provision for incompleteness, it is important to see things and humans not only as intricately entangled, but also as open-ended composites.","https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=202016883163&site=ehost-live"

There are now important projects that map change in the American city along a number of dimensions, including zoning, suburbanization, commercial development, transportation infrastructure, and especially segregation. Most projects use their visual sources to illustrate the material consequences of the policies of powerful agencies and dominant planning 'regimes.' As useful as these projects are, they often inadvertently imbue their visualizations with an aura of inevitability, and thereby present political power as a kind of static substance-possess this and you can remake the city to serve your interests. A new project called 'Imagined San Francisco' is motivated by a desire to expand upon this approach, treating visual material not only to illustrate outcomes, but also to interrogate historical processes, and using maps, plans, drawings, and photographs not only to show what did happen, but also what might have happened. By enabling users to layer a series of historical urban plans-with a special emphasis on unrealized plans-'Imagined San Francisco' presents the city not only as a series of material changes, but also as a contingent process and a battleground for political power.

This article discusses processes developed through ongoing work on the art historical visualization project Florence4D. It proposes an integrated approach where technologies for 3-D models, mapping, and location-aware augmented reality (AR) converge, while the research data is no more than a click away in structured ontology databases. The structure of the underlying data is key to creating a collaborative research space where the three broadly defined spatial technologies of 3-D and augmented reality, GPS, and geoinformation systems (GIS) interact, enabling researchers to move seamlessly between building-, local-, and urban-scale analysis and the interpretation of art, architecture, and urban design history.

In recent years, applications of SNA by historians and history-adjacent scholars have also increased dramatically, partly as a product of the growing field of digital humanities. In the North American sense of the term, the utility of social network analysis has yet to be substantively realized by historical archaeologists. In this paper, we use two case studies from the southeastern United States to illustrate the potential that social network analyses could offer historical archaeologists. In particular, we highlight how social network analysis can be employed as a framework for the integrated consideration of both archaeological and documentary evidence to explore the distribution, accumulation, control, and production of social capital in the past. In our first case study we leverage archaeological networks as a proxy for social capital to explore the contradictions and complementarity of archaeological data and the ethnohistorical record on the Indigenous politics of sixteenth-century Southern Appalachia. In our second example we examine networks of tasks and spaces across a nineteenth-century enslaved community on the Georgia Coast to understand how social capital can be differentially accumulated and accessed within particular spaces and practices. Through these examples, we demonstrate the potential for social network analysis to enrich the research programs and support the goals of North American historical archaeologists and to link such research into broader themes across the social and humanistic sciences.

The starting point is the records within the Archive: records of the University and from former higher educational institutions – Escuela de Magisterio and Colegio Universitario de Castellón (1900–1991) – along with other external holdings. These are indispensable information resources for research into university history, but they are also useful for researching subjects such as the evolution of teaching, economics, university life and for biographical study. In the current culture of ""openness,"" a context which includes European legislation on digitization and on heritage and using new concept of Digital Humanities, the Archive can respond to the new challenges and engage in innovative lines of work which are adding value to the historical records. Current projects of the university Archive are discussed, projects which recognize the importance of understanding the user, digitization, open access, dissemination and cooperation. These projects show that by expanding the traditional services it offers, a university archive can become a mainstay for learning, teaching and research within the institution, resulting in turn in more users and a new role.

Landmark projects over the past century introduced various classification systems and initiated important debates within the field. From the author's perspective, classification of data is understood as a necessary precursor to computation in these projects. Classificatory thinking is used here as a theme to explore debates that have arisen when abstractions of musical practice have been suggested for use with ethnomusicology. The paper proposes that a recent approach to research practice for embedding computation adds to ongoing interdisciplinary work, demonstrating novel ways of contextualizing archival materials with ethnography alongside computation. The approach attempted to strike a balance for engaging large amounts of data in ethnomusicology. The paper argues that some resulting tensions arising from classification lead to insights, which cannot be drawn by ethnomusicological methods alone.

There is surprisingly little scholarly literature, however, on the process of database construction in humanities projects. This article describes a process of interdisciplinary database design that emerged in the course of building the core sections of an historical GIS of Holocaust ghettos. The process foregrounds collaborative design, testing that purposely flushes out paradigmatic differences and ontological problems, and revision to incorporate group decisions and agreed-upon meanings into data structures, field definitions, and instructions for data entry. The result is a deeply integrative form of mixed methodology that incorporates ethical standards along with data entry instructions and team training.

Alongside these advances, equal progress is under way in the realm of scholarly communication. Developments in the areas of peer review, scholarly collaboration, and digital publishing, including thi development of Open Journal Systems (OJS), spur the growth of online cultural and intellectual communities surrounding humanistic endeavour. As these advancements progress alongside each other, the question of how they might be integrated remains. Coupling advancements in the realm of digital scholarship with new forms of publishing and peer review promises to leverage the affordances of both, making public-facing platforms for cultural content, while building vibrant intellectual communities around them.

Not only being concerned, analysed and criticized by scholars from Humanities and social sciences, AI also plays an important role in empirical research methods, thus facilitating the transformation of research paradigms in these fields. At present, neuro-symbolic AI, as a new product of the integration of two major factions in the field of artificial intelligence - connectionism and symbolism, has high application value in studying and solving the humanistic and social problems involving massive data due to its learning capability of perceiving the environment as well as reasoning capability of manipulating symbols. The introduction of neuro-symbolic AI is also of great significance for the development of emerging interdisciplinary fields such as digital humanities and computational social sciences. This paper aims to clarify the connections between neuro-symbolic AI and Humanities and social sciences, summarize the latest developing trends and representative applications, and explore a feasible path for the expansion of pluralistic methodologies in Humanities and social sciences to adapt to the age of big data.

In recent years, its evolution has been witnessed foremost in the growth of funded DH projects and through the willingness of scholars from diverse backgrounds to not only work in DH research, but also as 'digital humanists'. One crucial component to DH research is that of spatial enquiry, the expansion of which has rapidly evolved from a small component often found buried in research objectives, to the research aim of a growing number of projects. Spatial humanities, while still a relatively new interdisciplinary field, is exhibiting continued advancement and focus from the academic community; however, working with digital data is rarely a straightforward pursuit, even for the most accomplished scholar. Primarily access to appropriate and reliable (spatial) datasets, the keystone of spatial humanities research, the sharing and openness of spatial methods, tools and data (SMTD), and education in the former, all remain a challenge. Witnessing the continued rise of spatial humanities research, this special issue brings together a selection of articles delivered at Spatial Humanities 2016, a conference held at Lancaster University (UK). The aim of this multi-disciplinary conference was to explore and demonstrate the contribution to knowledge that spatial technologies in humanities research may enable within and beyond the digital humanities. Here, this introductory text and associated articles present key research that embodies the growing relevance of the spatial humanities across a plethora of fields and demonstrates several of the prevailing and enduring struggles when working in digital and spatial research. These articles emphasise that, despite common obstacles, spatial humanists make up an imaginative and thriving community keen to share innovation and knowledge and provide stimulating new insights through research.

But to scholars in writing studies, his work is illuminative due to his rhetorical analysis of church documents and his discussion of eloquentia perfecta when examining Jesuit education.1 More recently, in works like ""'Not for Ourselves Alone,"" he stresses the importance of Jesuit education focusing on the betterment of others inside and outside of the academy.2 During an interview conducted four months before his death, O'Malley restated the necessity of Jesuit education including writing and vita activa, that is, active civic life. In this article, we pay tribute to O'Malley's scholarship connecting eloquentia perfecta and vita activa by overviewing two O'Malley-inspired digital public humanities projects and the work completed on them by two graduate students at Saint Louis University. The graduate students reflect on the value of these contributions to their Jesuit education. Please note that this essay pairs with another in this issue, ""John W.

Taking ‘The White Man's Burden’ as its particular example, this article recovers the history of that poem's publication and initial reception. That history revises both the poem's date and place of first publication, from Britain to America. In the process, Kipling emerges as a more transatlantic poet than was previously thought, and as a figure who is more influential in America. He is seen to have a sophisticated understanding of the demands and nature of newsprint, of newspapers as a literary and poetic medium, and of newspaper poetry as a journalistic genre. Many agencies and interested parties are seen to be involved in the poem's publication, and the nature of its cultural success offers further evidence for a transatlantic press history.

Through the figure of Lajos Kossuth, whose publicity tour of the United States in 1852 generated support for Hungarian independence, this paper demonstrates that big-data and digital analysis tools such as topic modeling can reveal key details about how states and communities perceived European imperialism, depending on their own national circumstances. The paper shows how his journey came to be refracted through national and international political goals as well as the popular consumption of celebrity news.

Hence, cross-disciplinary teams would greatly benefit from using a language technology-based tool that allows for the (at least semi-) automated resolution of ambiguous terms. Although no such tool is readily available, an interesting theoretical outline of one does exist. The main obstacle for the concrete realization of this tool is the current lack of an effective method for the automatic detection of the different meanings of ambiguous terms across different disciplinary jargons. In this paper, we set up a pilot study to experimentally assess whether the word sense induction technique of ‘context clustering’, as implemented in the software package ‘SenseClusters’, might be a solution. More specifically, given several sets of sentences coming from a cross-disciplinary corpus containing a specific ambiguous term, we verify whether this technique can classify each sentence in accordance to the meaning of the ambiguous term in that sentence. For the experiments, we first compile a corpus that represents the disciplinary jargons involved in a project on Bone Tissue Engineering. Next, we conduct two series of experiments. The first series focuses on determining appropriate SenseClusters parameter settings using manually selected test data for the ambiguous target terms ‘matrix’ and ‘model’. The second series evaluates the actual performance of SenseClusters using randomly selected test data for an extended set of target terms. We observe that SenseClusters can successfully classify sentences from a cross-disciplinary corpus according to the meaning of the ambiguous term they contain. Hence, we argue that this implementation of context clustering shows potential as a method for the automatic detection of the meanings of ambiguous terms in cross-disciplinary communication.

The ultimate goal of PAThs project is to build new bridges between these two disciplines by creating an online atlas able to represent Coptic literature in its archaeological context, testing methodological frameworks and building IT tools based on network technologies. We believe that information technology, widely used since long time by both disciplines, can provide a common ground for experimentation and fruitful collaboration: PAThs information system discussed in this paper has proven to be an important test bench for the development of new methodologies and the improvement of the studies.

The aestheticist position is broadly defined by the extension of literary values into the digital milieu, as it is articulated in the work of Johanna Drucker, N. Katherine Hayles, and Jerome McGann. The populist position rather emphasises engagement with contemporary social media, as it is represented by the work of Pierre Lévy and Henry Jenkins. This comparison is designed to analyse a problematic parity between the two positions that is couched in their conception of archives and texts as being infinite; an infinitude that is political in the sense that engagement with it may facilitate or prohibit subjective agency and collective knowledge. Yet, through deconstruction, this analysis is designed to propose an alternate conception that negotiates the difficult relation between the finite and the infinite aspects of technological memory accumulation, and that poses the possibility of an alternate politics that problematically links the poles of engagement and disengagement with such accumulation.

Drawing on assemblage theory and radical media archeology, I describe the technological processes that link together materially different spatiotemporal assemblages to produce a posthuman condition of computer vision typified by what Wolfgang Ernst terms the ""epistemogenic momentum"" of ""techno-mathematical configurations."" Manuel DeLanda's flat ontologies prove useful here for describing how assemblages operating in different space-times interact. I then turn to Deleuze and Guatarri's techno-semiological stratum, specifically their discussion of the stratum's spatiotemporal superlinearity, to articulate an emerging digital-calculative layer. I argue that understanding computer vision assemblages requires more than setting technical descriptions alongside cultural-ideological critique; it also requires an integrated analysis of the roles digital nonhumans perform in the production of a new visual regime with new capacities and desires. The shared human-nonhuman capacity of computer vision moves sight from the biological and linguistic assemblages of humans into digital assemblages where vision becomes calculable and subject to algorithmic modifications. The results are not only digitally-composed, screened images, but also new means of production, organization, and identity.

The project was a collaborative effort of two external researchers, the editorial team, and nine caucus volunteers. The basis for the analysis was the author biographies, in which information on pronouns and academic rank were computationally extracted. Racial information was not provided at publication, so a research process was formed to get the most viable results. In addition to the analysis regarding the authors, [End Page 1] the project also analyzed published content. Here, the caucus volunteers analyzed the contents of each article with a focus on the relevancy to their caucus's interests. They provided further analysis by identifying subtopics of the articles.

Under various banners – historical GIS, qualitative and mixed methods GIS, spatial and digital history, digital humanities, spatial humanities or geohumanities – researchers have developed new ways to include qualitative data within the framework of GIS. At the same time, social and theoretical critiques of GIS as a tool wielded chiefly by and for those in power have increased awareness of its limitations, particularly for studying human perceptions, experiences, and the meanings of place. We agree with a growing chorus of geographers that the most common data structures in GIS are inadequate to capture or analyze the relational dimensions of subjectivity. As part of the solution, we propose an alternative hybrid framework that prioritizes topological relationships while retaining coordinate locations as points of connection between geographic places and experiential evidence. This article explains how the challenges posed by Holocaust survivor testimony inspired us to pursue inductive spatial analysis and non-coordinate means of mapping. We then set out a model for a topological GIS and illustrate its application with two survivor testimonies and a map of their experiences.

We envisage our very world as ‘networked.’ ‘The network’ also has aesthetic or formal possibilities: in the interconnected, reticular, knotted or participatory work. Interest in networks from within literary study arose arguably out of cultural history and sociology, where a ‘social text’ was imagined, partly as a means to displace an outmoded focus on the single author, the autonomous individual, the heroic genius. Readers and texts are imagined together forming ‘networks’ of meaning, feeling, and judgement. But do we take the concept for granted? Though powerful as a tool, is it also somewhat blunt? Can we ever succeed in ‘mapping’ a cultural network, or describing one accurately? Is the metaphor too knotty or nodal for the fluid forms it hopes to catch in its structures? What absences does this metaphor forget? Do we overvalue the notion of a network from the context of our own professional networks, at the cost of forgetting the disconnected? Does disconnection from the ideas of disconnection explain the shock and surprise at how recent democratic processes unfolded? Referring to my research that considers formations and disruptions of cultural networks and of value at the outbreak of World War 2, and to representations of data in the Digital Humanities, my paper addresses these questions amongst others.

Birbirine bağlı, retiküler, düğümlü veya katılımcı eserlerde, bu ağ, aynı zamanda, estetik ya da biçimsel olanaklara da sahiptir. Edebi çalışmalar içerisinde ağlara olan ilgi, bir „sosyal metnin‟ tek yazara, özerk bireye ve destansı dehaya yöneltilmiş olan modası geçmiş bakışı kısmen yerinden ettiği düşünülen bir araç olarak kültürel tarih ve sosyolojiden tartışmalı bir şekilde ortaya çıkmıştır. Okuyucuların ve metinlerin bir araya gelerek bir anlam, duygu ve yargı ağı kurdukları düşünülür. Acaba bu kavramı hafife mi alıyoruz? Acaba bu kavram, bir araç olarak güçlü olduğu halde, aynı zamanda biraz körelmiş midir? Herhangi bir kültürel ağı, haritalamada ya da tam olarak açıklamada hiç başarılı olabilir miyiz? Acaba metafor kendi bünyesinde yakalamayı umduğu akışkan formlar için çok karmaşık veya düğümlü müdür? Bu metafor hangi boşlukları, bağlantı eksiklerini unutmaktadır? Kendi profesyonel ağlarımızın bağlamında olan bir ağ kavramına, kopuk olan ağı unutma pahasına, gereğinden fazla mı değer veriyoruz? Kopukluk fikirlerinden kopmak son demokratik süreçlerin nasıl geliştiğine dair şoku ve şaşkınlığı açıklıyor mu? Bu çalışma, başka konuların yanı sıra, 2.

For this research, an historical GIS was populated from paper map archives denoting where and when bitumen roads were sealed in the Bega Valley, NSW. Using existing geospatial methods, a temporally sensitive network analysis was conducted, revealing a picture of regional mobility reshaped by modernist infrastructure improvements. Yet a straightforward binary pitting sealed roads as 'good' vs unsealed roads as 'bad' was challenged in subsequent qualitative interviews with long-time residents. Instead, a range of opinions emerged about the role that differing road surfaces played in everyday and historic mobilities. A fuller picture of the motivations and cultural associations of bitumen vs dirt road driving resulted from deploying humanities research methods of interviewing and discourse analysis. Such an approach revealed preferences and motivations that sometimes challenged inferences gained from mapping results alone. There are limits then in relying solely on historical cartographic data to produce maps and spatial representations and existing humanities techniques may hold, in some instances, greater explanatory power.

As an interdisciplinary field, the digital humanities have transformed the relationship of humans to computers broadly conceived. At the same time, the methods, theories, perspectives and the concomitant digital tools developed are being criticized for reproducing the social divisions that exist in society. The effort to recover Black women's subjectivities from the digital minefield is not without its challenges, reflected in our study which searched approximately 800,000 books, newspapers, and articles in the HathiTrust and JSTOR Digital Libraries. The goal was to identify perceptions and lived experiences of Black women that emerged and the resulting knowledge that developed. The project team discovered multiple challenges related to the rescue and recovery of Black women's standpoints or group knowledge. This essay explores how even as computational analysis has embedded biases, it can be utilized to recover the experiences of Black women from within the digitized record. Thus, computational analysis and all that it encompasses not only makes visible Black women's experiences, but also expands the scope of the digital humanities.

Mellon Foundation, engaged five postdoctoral fellows placed in five different institutions to explore issues related to data curation for medieval studies. In May 2015, these fellows convened a two-day workshop on the sharing and publishing of Linked Open Data (LOD). Funded by a CLIR/Mellon microgrant, the workshop brought together librarians, technologists, and scholars to brainstorm on the challenges posed to medievalists in sharing data on digital platforms. 2 The workshop offered a forum in which to discuss the complexity of medieval data and the challenges of sharing and publishing it. It enabled participants to appreciate LOD's potential to express complicated data sets in our area of study and aid the navigation of those data sets, as well as understand how LOD can facilitate scholars to share and publish research outcomes more effectively. In this article, we take the lessons learned from the workshop and apply them to a set of complex data: 13th-century French motets, short pieces of music usually consisting of three lines and incorporating manifold connections and references. Following an outline of LOD, a detailed explanation of the motet and the manner of its composition will set the scene for elucidating the levels of complexity to be found in motet metadata, and hence why the LOD model can aid us in negotiating the data. We will then demonstrate an effective application of LOD by proposing a proof-of-concept system for organizing a select set of motets.

ARC is the hub for these period-specific nodes, which offer digital project peer review, aggregation and search technologies, and forms of community engagement. The mission of both ARC and the nodes is to construct and support a""social system"" for the humanities in which the digital and the traditional can come together to develop a working social humanities infrastructure. This article discusses how the ARC infrastructure evolved from the framework of scholarly engagement developed by NINES (Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship) and explains how the consortium assists the scholarly community: through digital project peer review, aggregation and search, and outreach services.

A close examination of Robert Kitaj's portrait Warburg as a Maenad (1961-62) affirms Warburg's 'combinatory experiments' (Christopher D. Johnson) to be a main characteristic of his practice. Warburg seems to have operated by applying what can now be described as metadata to the processes of transmission of culture he was accessing in form of migrating images. Further, the insights he was able to gain, namely his famous notion of the 'Pathosformel', may have to be considered as a specific form of metadata too. This is of particular interest acknowledging that in the digital world the migration of images takes mainly place in the realm of metadata. Hence ideas put forward by Warburg are able contribute to a deeper understanding of such phenomena.

Despite significant steps forward, this potential has been only partially realized as illustrated by DH pioneer Edward L. Ayers' recent question, 'Does Digital Scholarship have a future?' As a way to think through current challenges and opportunities, this paper reflects on the building and initial use of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI). As one of the largest projects in the history of the social sciences and humanities, CCRI enables research on the making of modern Canada by offering complex databases that cover the first half of the twentieth century. Built by scholars from multiple disciplines from coast-to-coast and in collaboration with government agencies and the private sector, CCRI team members came to grips with key DH questions especially those faced by interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, cross-sectoral and internationally-connected initiatives. Thinking through this experience does not generate simple recipes or lessons-learned but does offer promising practices as well as new questions for future scholarly consideration.

In detail, the approach here described adopts a bi-dimensional vision: considering the model as both a process of abstraction, an interpretation from a certain point of view, and a formal language to implement this abstraction in order to create something processable by a machine. The role of conceptual models - to be converted into ontologies - as a semantic deepening of controlled vocabularies, is the translation of this vision. Ontologies are the models used in domain communities in order to share classes and predicates for conceptual interoperability. Thinking of data models as a knowledge organization system is the core of this reflection on Digital Humanities domain.

Until recently, the rarity of this material imposed on its management a series of prohibitions that made research difficult.

Using The Live Art Collection of the UK Web Archive as its case study, the article draws on influences from oral history, new media theory and the digital humanities. Beginning with an assertion that the Web has a tendency to aggregate existing media forms into one archival location, the article makes the case that online writing is key to web archiving's potential to document new kinds of knowledge about performance and live art. Subsequently it points to limitations in the current archival structures of the collection and concludes that further innovation is required in order to maximize the scholarly potential of the material contained within it. Interviews with the team who manage and curate the collection are used throughout to support assertions about the collections intended use and functions.

Digitisation is therefore justifiable as a conservation directive however what of those volumes that are not chosen? Are we creating an alternative version of Victorian culture through so selective a gaze? Indeed, who is choosing these titles? There is a question of access, both of what material is available to digitise and also what it is perceived ‘the audience’ want. However, a further question is raised—who are ‘the audience’? What are these archives going to be used for? This article will examine the different forms of nineteenth-century periodical and newspaper archives that are available, how they are organised and who their perceived audience is, before going on to consider the pedagogical utility of such sites. How can we enhance students' understanding of nineteenth-century culture by using these archives in our lecture theatres? And if we do, what are the implications for research in the future?

Scholars and development organisations have reported on the end results of digital tools, for example by examining the ability of governments and development organisations to send early-warning weather reports through enhanced cellular access; the use of SMS to engage in deliberative polling; and the use of WIFI connections to provide banking services. However, researchers have not yet fully addressed how these tools are changing the communicative norms and ethnographic research methods used between researchers and mobile pastoralists. These changing communicative norms embed relations that inform academic understanding of the opportunities that arise from the interplay of complex forms of social and economic variability as experienced by herders. This paper draws from the fields of Communication and Anthropology to understand how these same ICTs have changed the complex communication between herders and researchers through the establishment of new communicative networks. I ask how new communicative networks impact on both existing and emerging ethnographic research practices and how the emergent 'digital field' of research might open space for new communicative networks and research projects. Then, I propose that digital ethnography may be one way in which both herders and researchers can respond to variability while establishing research projects wherein herders are recognised both as participants in a research project and as co-producers of knowledge.

An exploration of postcolonial digital humanities methods, this article brings together quantitative textual analysis of news media articles from the United States and United Kingdom, postcolonial theory, and selfie scholarship to explore the representation of Syrian refugees in the newsmedia and their self-representation in selfies. Examining ""migrantrelated selfies"" theorized in scholarship on migrant media, I argue that photographs of refugees taking selfies are being marshaled by news media to complement reporting on immigration anxieties within the Global North. On the other hand, ""refugee selfies,"" the images refugees themselves are taking, avoid co-optation into such narratives. They do so, I propose, as a form of self-representation that produces agency, creates communities, and resists the inscription of refugees as objects of knowledge in the digital cultural record.

Does it dictate the transition between arguments in a chapter, or the transition between chapters in a book, or the transition between books in the system? This paper suggests that Hegel's method can be seen to work at the level of paragraph composition. It proposes that Hegel's use of a certain form of paragraph is consistent with his account of his method. This use reflects how Hegel conceptualizes thought processes; and it is frequent, employed semi-systematically throughout Hegel's major works. The proposal is substantiated both through a close reading of Hegel's description of his method, and through a quantitative investigation (or ""distant reading"") of Hegel's works. The paper further suggests, and demonstrates, that Hegel's writings can be made more legible if the dialectical structure of his paragraphs is made conspicuous. Moreover, this paper lives at the shadowy fringes between design, the digital humanities, and the history of philosophy. It investigates the ways algorithms and design principles can be used to investigate Hegel's philosophy.

In terms of mindfulness-directed effort, which academic disciplines are outpacing which? Has the degree of disembeddedness from Buddhist contexts changed over time? What is the relationship between trends in mindfulness, meditation, and Buddhism-oriented literature? Through a bibliometric analysis of mindfulness literature within academic journals, several patterns emerge. Results support a substantial increase in ‘academic effort’ toward mindfulness, crossing a number of disciplines, independent of increased publications concerning meditation, Buddhism, or in these fields at large. While the psychological disciplines have dominated mindfulness literature for several decades, their ‘share’ of the overall pool of academic literature has not increased in recent years. Mindfulness-related effort in the humanities, too, is at an all-time high, but not so from a ‘share’ perspective. Other disciplines are grabbing a larger slice of the pie. This bibliometric analysis aids the interdisciplinary field of mindfulness studies in exploring where they started, factors contributing to subsequent transformations, and how discrete contributing fields relate to one another in the context of the overall field of mindfulness studies.

In this paper, we provide a bottom-up approach by analyzing geography dissertations. We start by assembling a database that includes the title, author, date, and university for every geographic doctoral dissertation written in the United States over the last 120 years. The database allows us to track the rise and fall of regions of interest and specific topics. It gives a broad overview of the different schools in geography and their influence within separate historical periods. And it permits a more empirically based delineation of geographical 'eras' based on the commonality of words in dissertation titles. This work is at the convergence of the quantitative and qualitative; we quantify and visualize textual data to provide a more robust history of geography. The result is a new, more comprehensive way to look at the changing discipline of geography.

It draws on a conceptual framework encompassing the digital humanities, museology, Baudrillard's notion of simulation, as well as contemporary research and similar studies. Digital curation of a Visionary Environment, which falls into the ambit of Outsider Art, is a largely unprecedented practice, especially in the context of South Africa. This qualitative study is situated in a social constructivist paradigm and uses elements of a phenomenological approach. As an instance of qualitative research, at the heart of this study is an emphasis on understanding how people construct their realities and interpret their experiences. The experiences of interpreting and viewing digital artefacts outside of a museum are not the same as viewing them in real life. This inevitably changes the way that someone experiences and interprets a collection. The challenge of digitising a museum is thus to understand what this transformation process (physical to digital) does to the integrity of the original collection. Digitisation within museums offers so many possibilities, especially in the context of site specific museums that are largely inaccessible like the Owl House. A digitally curated collection of high quality digital media can allow for a museum like the Owl House to be visited digitally, and moreover, that visitors can interpret a museum experience that is rich and layered. The data for this study was collected from interviews with participants who engaged with a digitised sub-collection of the Owl House--The Long Bedroom Collection, and after an initial presentation and analysis of the data, emerging themes were discussed.

Key amongst these is the use of innovative visualization techniques that can assist in the understanding of the spatial and temporal features of film industry practices. However, like the cinema itself, visualization carries its own spatial and temporal dimension. This article explores some of the benefits and limitations that derive from the use of spatial visualization technologies in the field of cinema studies. In particular, this research presents a new holistic multivariate approach to spatio-temporal visualization for point based historical data. This method has been developed through extending the spatial presence in timeline graphics and through meaningful spatial classification and representation.

Full-text search lets historians now find new sources that can change their understanding of thoroughly studied historical episodes. At the same time, it forces scholars to access historical sources in a new way: through specific words. This article analyses the consequences of this new way of accessing sources and investigates which search technologies are best suited for historical source selection in digital repositories. It argues that to seize the opportunities that digitization offers, historians must refine their search technologies so that they are based on words but are less dependent on exact phraseology.

By some accounts, there are 1,200 editions of the work published in thirty world languages, all of which trace back to a single manuscript—itself a copy of an earlier Mayan work. To protect their work from being destroyed by colonial officials or Inquisitional authorities, the original K’iche’ authors of the Popol Wuj had to embed their ways of knowing in a language and narrative structure that could not be detected by Spanish readers. Each edition of the Popol Wuj therefore helps to uncover different elements of the cosmovisión that is embedded in the text. This article draws from recent collaborative efforts to prepare a digital critical edition of the PopolWuj based on the editorial standards and scholarly conventions of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). By comparing and contrasting the advantages and drawbacks of this edition relative to printed works and digital editions, we suggest how methods from the digital humanities can shed new light on texts like the Popol Wuj.

"POSSIBILITIES OF EXTENDING DIGITAL HUMANITIES INTO SEMANTIC WEB ENVIRONMENT: THE CASE STUDY OF CROATIAN MEDIEVAL MANUSCRIPTS AND INCUNABULA AND THEIR FRAGMENTS.","Tomić, Marijana; Willer, Mirna","Knygotyra",="02042061",,="2013",,"61","254","24","92883782",,"Vilnius University","Article","Manuscripts; Incunabula; Semantic Web; Information science; Croatia; University of Zadar; Digital humanities","digital humanities; fragments; incunabula; linked open data; medieval manuscripts","The article deals with the research on and description of medieval manuscripts and incunabula and their fragments as part of the digital humanities project in the context of the Semantic Web. It first describes the case study of Croatian medieval manuscripts and incunabula proposed as a research project by the Department of Information Sciences, University of Zadar. The focus of the project was directed at the selection of data elements required for detailed description of the mentioned material and their standardization using ontologies developed by the old and rare book community's disciplines such as bibliography, codicology, palaeography and typography. A brief introduction to the technological infrastructure of the Semantic Web and its standards follows, with a detailed description of methodology to publish a selected vocabulary in one of the metadata registry services. This section of the article concludes with the RDF graph for the partially reconstituted record of a fragment description as an example of publishing linked open data. As each of the mentioned disciplines uses its own value vocabularies or ontologies, it is suggested that mappings between their terms is designed using SKOS rules, rather than aiming at the use of one common vocabulary. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Rankraščių rinkiniai -- tai labai įvairaus pobūdžio rankraščiai, paprastai apibrėžiami kaip „ranka ant popieriaus arba pergamento užrašytas tekstas arba dokumentas“ (Peter Beal). Tai gali būti šeimos ar asmeniniai dokumentai, dienoraščiai, laiškai, archyvų rinkiniai ir kt. Viduramžių rankraščiai -- kodeksai, žemėlapiai, muzikos kūriniai arba jų fragmentai -- sudaro specialią rankraš čių rūšį. Kaip ir inkunabulai, rankraščių rinkiniai yra vertingiausia bibliotekų paveldo dalis, dėl jų mus pasiekia itin daug informacijos apie viduramžių istoriją, kultūrą, literatūrą, socialinę istoriją, gyvenimo tendencijas. Be šių šaltinių informacija būtų dingusi. Senų ir retų rankraščių tyrimai svarbūs tiek šalies, tiek visos Europos kultūros ir socialinei istorijai. Žvelgiant iš humanitarinių mokslų perspektyvos, būtina išskirti keletą veiksnių, kurie lėmė reikšmingus pokyčius tyrinėjant rankraščius ir pirmąsias spausdintines knygas. Pačiu svarbiausiu laikomas informacinių technologijų poveikis beveik visoms tyrimo sritims. Šie pokyčiai lėmė ir naujos disciplinos -- skaitmeninių humanitarinių mokslų atsiradimą. Pasak Toby'o Burrowso, viduramžių tyrinėtojai yra „pažangiausi skaitmeninių technologijų taikymo humanitarinių mokslų tyrimuose atstovai“. Vis dėlto T. Burrowsas išskiria ir keletą keblumų, susijusių su interneto ir skaitmeninės bibliotekos paslaugomis. Jis nurodo „integracijos ir sąveikos tarp daugybės skirtingų interneto svetainių stygių“ bei terminologijos nenuoseklumą taikant aprašomuosius standartus. Savo ruožtu tai sukelia probleminę situaciją, nes „tyrinėtojams visame pasaulyje kyla daug sunkumų rasti, naudotis ir dalytis žiniomis apie viduramžių rankraščių kolekcijas“. Visiškai pritariame T. Burrowso minčiai, kad šią problemą galima išspręsti sukuriant tarptautinę bendradarbiavimo infrastruktūrą, kuri leistų tvarkyti turinį ir tarpusavyje susijusias žinias. Mūsų nuomone, ši infrastuktūra gali būti įgyvendinta technologinėje semantinio žiniatinklio ir sujungtų atvirų duomenų (angl. Semantic Web and Linked Open Data) terpėje. Straipsnyje aptariami viduramžių rankraščių ir inkunabulų bei jų fragmentų tyrimai ir šių šaltinių aprašymas kaip skaitmeninių humanitarinių mokslų projekto dalis, taikant šią naują technologiją. Nagrinėjamas šios srities Kroatijos Zadaro universiteto Informacijos mokslų fakulteto vykdomas mokslinių tyrimų projektas. Projekto tikslas -- atrinkti duomenų elementus, reikalingus tiksliam minėtų šaltinių aprašymui ir jų standartizavimui, naudojant senų ir retų knygų tyrinėtojų parengtas bibliografijos, kodikologijos, paleografijos bei tipografijos ontologijas. Straipsnyje pateikiamas ir trumpas technologinės semantinio tinklo infrastruktūros bei jo standartų įvadas. Detaliai aprašoma metodika, padedanti paskelbti pasirinktą žodyną kaip vieną iš metaduomenų registro paslaugų. Pateikiamas sujungtų atvirų duomenų paskelbimo pavyzdys -- pristatatomas grafikas, vaizduojantis iš dalies rekonstruoto rankraščio fragmento aprašymą. Kadangi visos minėtos disciplinos naudoja savo žodynus ir ontologijas, straipsnio autorės siūlo orientuotis ne į vieno bendro žodyno naudojimą, o į atitinkamų terminų sąsajų projektavimą vadovaujantis SKOS taisyklėmis. Taip būtų kuriami būsimos tarptautinės bendradarbiavimo struktūros pagrindai.

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines (law, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing. As the use of provenance reaches new domains it is no longer just an organizing principle but also a means of reaching for authenticity and reliability of data and objects in digital environments or museums or to reestablish the original organic relationship in library collections.

This method, based on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, automates data-scraping for podcast reviews and ratings. We describe and critically reflect on this process in order to understand not only how listeners describe their range of motivations for engagement with music podcasts, but also the limitations of this approach in a media and cultural studies context.","https://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=202226276890&site=ehost-live"

This essay discusses the project’s origins as well as its methodological and epistemological foundations. Alternative Toronto is rooted in twin frustrations: with approaches to Canadian history that ignore its radical edges as well as its feminist, anti-racist, Indigenous and LGBTQ+ struggles; and with U.S.- and U.K.-centric radical histories that fail to consider movements beyond their borders. To counter these tendencies, the project adopts – and adapts – the spirit of Britain’s History Workshop movement, which created community-based spaces for collaborative historical inquiry that were open to scholars, independent historians and community members alike. By doing so, it asks how digital tools and a dialogic approach to copyright can be used to democratize the archive as both a site and a process, in keeping with the non-hierarchical principles of its subject. It also hopes that by remediating the audiocassettes, videotapes and print materials that were lost in the transition from analogue to digital formats, the site will encourage contributors and visitors to engage in the radical mediation of Toronto’s recent past.

It enables a variety of user interactions with the manuscript using a large multitouch tabletop computer, including viewing and navigating high-resolution scans, viewing superimposed translations of the text, searching manuscript text and metadata, viewing modern editions of musical items, and listening to musical audio. These modes of interaction synthesize information traditionally available in different places (editions, facsimiles, translations, editorial commentary) to create new modes of interaction with digital manuscripts for students, scholars and the general public. The project has been developed using standard design practices from human–computer interaction, mindful of the implications of adapting such practices for a digital humanities domain. Engaging students in the design and implementation of these new tools has also created unique educational opportunities by raising fundamental questions about encoding practices and manuscript culture alike. Work currently in progress involves the creation of an ‘application programming interface’ for Fauvel and other digital manuscripts, which will enable other scholars and programmers to build new and different types of interactions on top of our existing project infrastructure.

Opportunistic geosocial data from crowdsourced and user contributions are typically available in large quantities, however, these data are generally not sampled or collected with intentionality for research purposes. Therefore, digital traces from geolocationally-enabled devices may not provide data that are directly relevant to addressing precise questions or being used in applications of societal interest. It is crucial to first understand characteristics of geosocial data prior to proceeding with interpretation. The spatial humanities could encourage realization of the role data analysts and researchers play in creating narrative in light of large opportunistic data with many facets of uncertainty. An approach is proposed that suggests directions of inquiry into data limitations based on the characteristics of the source and the properties of the data. Finally, this article notes that the digital world influences the activities of individuals in real-life so the generalizability of the behaviour of users may be limited. Integrating other forms of relevant spatial data can help to bound uncertainty and constrain the interpretation of geosocial data.

If digitized, connected, and analyzed within the scope of digital humanities, these historical events will provide a new perspective for the study of humanities. However, it is hard to construct a universal rule for description. This study aims to design an event-based ontology that models, organizes, and represents historical events in an explicit way. Procedures for the construction of the historical event-based ontology are as follows: identifying and selecting typical events based on trigger words, analyzing the constituent elements of historical events, reusing concepts and properties by referencing existing ontology vocabularies, establishing the historical event-based ontology model, and validating the model with actual historical data. The verification results of each type of event and each instance are displayed in visual forms. A representative historical figure associated with several types of events is selected, and the event relationship network is established. With great potential to be further developed, the model will help historical scholars deal with areas such as economic and micro-social history. Future research will input more complete data to enlarge the scale of the model.

First, based on research into human databases created by Chinese libraries and analysis of information collected from 152 libraries, we selected three libraries for a case study whose research findings of DH projects have been put into practical application. Next, we collected relevant materials by means of interviews, literature research, network research, and other methods. Finally, the paper identifies some important issues, such as motivations, content, and cooperation, that need to be addressed when analyzing these programs by a case study. Some achievements have been made because of efforts by a number of Chinese libraries to develop DH, but accompanying these achievements are challenges. The paper puts forward the core problems for DH in Chinese public libraries and tries to give a numerical solution scheme that will help to promote the development of DH.

On the basis of previous research, the paper uses a questionnaire and statistical method to locate the shortage of digital academic competence of humanists. Proposing the digital academic competence of humanists' framework, the study involved a questionnaire related to the humanists' digital academic competence and developing a competence evaluation indicator system.

It is not only physical but also virtual, created with the use of cyber-techniques and the internet. The two layers of the environment are: the physical places, persons, objects, etc., and the virtual electronically-emerged places, persons, and objects, etc. Therefore, it is correct to overcome the enforced conceptual dualism between what is virtual and what is physical, as proposed by Michal Ostrowicki (aka Sidey Myoo) in calling for the recognition of the hybrid status of reality, by pointing to symbiosis within the context of lived experience. This raises questions on the kind of experience one has in a hybrid environment, and how this in turn influences one's practices and forms of being with others. Trying to respond to these questions will lead us to recognition of the ongoing transformation of aesthetic sensibility in a hybrid environment, and of the need for aesthetic reflection to respond to this. This will be done in the following paper by recognizing the community -building potential of art in both layers of a hybrid environment, the physical and the digital, which leads to emergence and functioning of communities in such an environment, showing the necessity of broader research in this field.

In an age of ‘big data’ we are seeing a broad reaching, and often uncritical fascination with data visualisation and its potential for knowledge generation. At its extreme this represents a fantasy of knowing, or total knowledge. Nonetheless, for those working in visual anthropology, big data and data visualisation offer significant extensions to our ways of knowing and our categories of knowledge. In this article we probe the fascination and potential of data visualisation and its relevance for understanding human experience, social relations and networks. First, we argue that the celebration of informational aesthetics can be understood as a version of the Kantian mathematical sublime. Extending this analysis, we argue that productive possibilities for thinking about data visualisation are to be found in Deleuze’s engagement with the diagram. The diagram, for Deleuze, does not represent but rather operates both as expression and problem resolution. It is incomplete in the dual sense of never capturing the totality of the object and in its dynamism. This approach points to the merits of this investment in data visualisation (the way it works as expression and problem resolution), but highlights the need to be cautious about fetishising the sublimity of ‘beautiful data’.

Background: Community-based practices of open source software development offer a model for enmeshed private-public digital humanities (DH) research that can balance the demands of macro or global digital disruptive forces with the needs of everyday learning communities. Analysis: In the space of enmeshed modes of digital communication, knowledge is not owned, since it is essentially discovery-based. Conclusion and implications: Digital literacy is key for contemporary DH knowledge production, yet also needs to be active (not a passive information technology awareness or ability) about building, making, and improving, as well as functioning within an open environment.

Music scholars have been aware of the transition in literary circles from written and printed media to digital media, but only now are these researchers beginning to consider the issues that digital humanists have long been debating. In particular, music scholars and performers have virtually ignored the issue of peer review for digital resources. This lacuna represents the most significant barrier for the creation and implementation of digital technologies in music research and editing. Without a mechanism by which individuals may receive credit for the hard work that goes into digital resources, most will direct their energies towards gaining peer review via traditional printed publications. This article argues for the creation of a mechanism for peer reviewing digital projects in music, noting the benefits of such a system for performers and researchers of early music.

Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a ""meaning problem"" due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth's arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet's that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning—a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century.

This paper presents an overview of the ROSSIO Infrastructure, its main objectives, the institutions involved, and the services offered by the infrastructure's aims through its platform—namely, a discovery portal, digital exhibitions, collections, and a virtual research environment. These services rely on a metadata-aggregation solution for bringing the digital objects' metadata from the providing institutions into ROSSIO. The aggregated datasets are converted into linked data and undergo an enrichment process based on controlled vocabularies, which are developed and published by ROSSIO. The paper will describe this process, the applications involved, and how they interoperate. We will further reflect on how these services may enhance the dissemination of science, considering the FAIR principles.

The SO is based on empirical research and earlier models and is designed so as to incorporate related works through a modular structure. The SO is an elaboration of the domain-independent core part of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology addressing the scholarly ecosystem of Digital Humanities. It thus provides a basis for developing domain-specific scholarly work ontologies springing from a common root. We define the basic concepts of the model and their semantic relations through four complementary perspectives on scholarly work: activity, procedure, resource and agency. As a use case we present a modelling example and argue on the purpose of use of the model through the presentation of indicative SPRQL and SQWRL queries that highlight the benefits of its serialization in RDFS. The SO includes an explicit treatment of intentionality and its interplay with functionality, captured by different parts of the model. We discuss the role of types as the semantic bridge between those two parts and explore several patterns that can be exploited in designing reusable access structures and conformance rules. Related taxonomies and ontologies and their possible reuse within the framework of SO are reviewed.

Claiming nearly 6 million readers monthly, the magazine's profiles of cities, states and regions have the potential to reach the niche audiences that shape the spatial practices of firms and influence individual decisions on tourism expenditures. This paper explores how Sky promotes places in the text of these profiles through the dual use of digital humanities tools and close reading-based interpretation to address the following questions. First, we ask how is the South represented in the Sky profiles? Second, what themes are present in the profile texts, given that all places seek to address both unique elements while addressing common themes of importance to business? We find that place promotion practitioners use very similar themes that have been identified in the literature since the 1980s, primarily accessibility. Efforts to attract the creative class are also present in the Sky profiles. The South poses unique challenges to place marketers, and our findings show a convergence in how profiles tackle the concept of southern culture and identity as it is leveraged in many of the profiles. La revista Sky de Delta Airlines afirma ser una fuente importante para las entidades que intentan promover varios lugares para la inversión económica y también para el turismo. Con más de seis millones de lectores mensuales, los perfiles Sky de las ciudades, los estados y las regiones tienen el potencial de llegar a audiencias específicas que dan forma a las prácticas espaciales de empresas e influyen las decisiones personales sobre los gastos en el turismo. Este artículo explora cómo el texto de Sky promueve varios lugares tras el uso dual de herramientas de humanidades digitales y una interpretación cercana basada en la lectura para abordar las siguientes preguntas. Primero preguntamos ¿cómo se representa el sur estadounidense en los perfiles Sky ? Segundo, ¿cuáles son los patrones en el texto de los perfiles, dado que todo lugar trata de presentarse como único pero también importante para el negocio? Encontramos que profesionales de la promoción usan temas similares que se han identificado en la literatura desde los años 1980—sobre todo la accesibilidad. Los esfuerzos para atraer la clase creativa también se presentan en los perfiles Sky. El sur estadounidense plantea desafíos únicos para el marketing. Nuestros hallazgos muestran una convergencia en la forma en que muchos de los perfiles abordan el concepto de cultura e identidad del sur estadounidense.

In the preliminary results, we have defined instance-based and schema-based categories of semantic enrichment. In the instance-based category, in which enrichment occurs by enhancing the content of entities, we further determined three types, including: 1) enriching the entities by linking to diverse external resources in order to provide additional data of multiple perspectives; 2) enriching the entities with missing data, which is needed to satisfy the semantic queries; and, 3) providing the entities with access to an extended knowledge base. In the schema-based categories that enrichment occurs by enhancing the relations between the properties, we have identified two types, including: 1) enriching the properties by defining the hierarchical relations between properties; and, 2) specifying properties' domain and range for data reasoning. In addition, the study implements the LOD dataset in a digital humanities platform to demonstrate how instances and entities can be applied in the full texts where the relationship between entities are highlighted in order to bring scholars more semantic details of the texts.

By examining specific aspects of librarians' curricular engagements, with a particular focus on reference and instructional activity, we discuss how reenvisioning these services aids in the development of effective support for both faculty and students engaged in DH. An included case study illustrates how redefining “traditional” librarian liaison roles and shifting expectations of faculty from one-shot instruction sessions to embedded librarianship models can be put into practice in undergraduate classrooms with a DH focus. The article concludes with a discussion of the librarian as digital humanist and how this role can positively impact undergraduate curricula.

This paper proposes a place for them in the historian's toolkit and explores through a few examples how, as a way to formally express an historical interpretation of a body of material, they provide a mechanism to potentially enrich the exploration and development of an historian's interpretation of that material. Highly structured data exhibits a kind of classical clarity of approach that does not fit well with current postmodern and post-Enlightenment trends in the humanities, and this article touches on these issues, and suggests a few approaches to them.

It is based on the idea of extracting statements relevant to literary history from bibliographies, scholarly publications and primary sources, in order to build a shared knowledge network for literary history. We employ methods from information extraction and text mining to obtain large numbers of statements about authors and literary works from our data. Moreover, we use the Linked Open Data paradigm to model, represent and query the information we obtain. We believe our project is a step towards a mode of digital humanities that goes not only beyond small, deeply encoded datasets and their close reading, but also beyond Big Data approaches that cannot always be easily adapted to the humanities. Instead, we propose a third way for digital humanities that develops quantitative methods to create and analyse datasets relevant to research in the humanities that are both larger and smarter than has been customary up until recently.

It seeks to illustrate this way of studying a software construct by applying it to a particular text analysis program. Fundamental aspects of this program's design (input and output, data structures, process model, and user interface) are reviewed and discussed from the point of view of their implications in terms of theoretical commitments to a specific conception of text and text analysis. The conclusions of this case study notably emphasize the central role of user modelling in the assessment of scientific software's epistemological contribution as well as the necessity of extending the proposed approach to a broader range of software applications.

Method: The sample consisted of 26 Somali American emerging adult and older adult refugees who created digital stories as part of the Immigrant Stories Project (https://immigrantstories.umn.edu/). Stories were analyzed through an examination of narrative structure and content. Results: The structure of the authors' stories was primarily progressive or stable, with very few regressive stories. Although the distribution of these story structures did not differ for emerging adults and older adults, there were important variations in content. Emerging adults' stories reflected a struggle to find self-continuity across time and place, whereas older adults' stories indicated attempts to find meaning and optimally adapt to their current situations. Moreover, none of the stories took on a redemptive structure, a type of story that has been identified as culturally prevalent in U.S. culture but seldom examined across diverse populations. Conclusions: The findings highlight the varieties of paths toward successful immigration and the importance of taking a collaborative, participatory approach to understanding migration experiences.

It features articles by four early-career Americanists (Emily Floyd, Alexandra Kaloyanides, Roxanne Korpan, and Martin Tsang) whose research bridges both areas. Because material texts research typically relies on archives for its source base, I asked the authors of the ""In Conversation"" essays (Matthew P.

While the collected eight pieces reflect the diversity and originality of their authors, they make several collective contributions. They demonstrate how material texts mediate power, especially amid encounters involving state, colonial, and missionary actors; exemplify the strength of interpretations informed by hands-on encounters with material texts; display a critical alertness to the structures through which material texts have been collected and made legible to researchers today; and show what we stand to gain from collaborative scholarship [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Material Religion is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

It offers a case study wherein DH was employed in the instruction and assessment activities of an upper division hybrid (i.e., combining traditional face-to-face and online instruction) Africana Studies course at a public university in southern California during the fall semester of the 2018–2019 academic year. The purpose of this experiment was to determine how Africana Studies might go beyond a mere engagement with DH questions, theories, and tools to show how DH coursework that is distinctly ""Africana"" in nature may be developed more centrally as a subfield of Africana Studies itself. The overarching questions guiding this experiment include the following: What does it mean to engage DH in Africana Studies? How might we teach DH in Africana Studies within the framework of its pedagogical and methodological objectives? How does Africana DH shape both collaborative and creative learning in the classroom?

This cultural quantification has been typically done by studying literary production. However, a society's value system might well be implicitly quantified based on the decisions that people took in the past and that were mediated by what they care about. It turns out that one class of these decisions is visible in ordinary settings: it is visible in street names. We studied the names of 4,932 honorific streets in the cities of Paris, Vienna, London and New York. We chose these four cities because they were important centers of cultural influence for the Western world in the 20th century. We found that street names greatly reflect the extent to which a society is gender biased, which professions are considered elite ones, and the extent to which a city is influenced by the rest of the world. This way of quantifying a society's value system promises to inform new methodologies in Digital Humanities; makes it possible for municipalities to reflect on their past to inform their future; and informs the design of everyday's educational tools that promote historical awareness in a playful way.

This is a creative expansion in critical GIS practices and a new alternative to traditionally science‐rooted approaches to GIS and mapping. Reflecting the experience of teaching a ""creative geovisualization"" course in an interdisciplinary curriculum, I demonstrate how critical and creative scholarship with mapping and geovisualization is introduced in the classroom and is illuminated in the students' creative practices. The class encompasses key epistemological and methodological groundings of creative geovisualization—including non‐representational theories; critical cartography and GIS; the convergence of geography, arts, and humanities; psychogeography; and qualitative and affective geovisualization. Empirical examples of students' works illustrate the blending of different modes of creative engagements with GIS and geovisualization and specific ways to work with various forms of embodied, relational, interpretive, and expressive geographies. GIS and mapping become creative as they continue evolving in process, and it is time that we deeply (re‐)imagine ""the creative"" in/of GIS in critical GIS pedagogies. Key Messages: Creative and critical engagements with GIS and critical GIS pedagogy highlight the convergence of geography, arts, and humanities.Teaching critical and creative forms of GIS helps students embrace and generate various modes of data and analysis that value representation in different ways.The integration of the creative in/of GIS points towards a new form of qualitative, affective, and creative GIS and geovisualization.

Il s'agit ici d'une innovation à partir des pratiques des SIG critiques et d'une nouvelle solution de rechange aux approches traditionnellement des SIG ancrées dans la science. Témoignant de l'expérience de l'enseignement d'un cours de « géovisualisation créative » à l'intérieur d'un programme interdisciplinaire, nous démontrons de quelle manière les missions professorales critique et créative face à la cartographie et la géovisualisation sont introduites dans la salle de classe afin de stimuler les pratiques créatives des étudiants.

Des exemples empiriques de travaux d'étudiants illustrent le mélange de différents modes d'engagements créatifs avec les SIG et la géovisualisation ainsi que les façons particulières de travailler avec diverses formes de géographies intégrées, relationnelles, interprétatives et expressives.

Organized around literary and historical periods, ARC is comprised of the directors of online scholarly communities that peer review digital projects and aggregate metadata for peer reviewed and other collections into an online search portal. The five ARC search portals are NINES, 18th Connect, MESA or medieval, ModNets or modernism, and ReKN or Renaissance (the latter two are forthcoming). In this article, we will discuss partnerships that ARC has established with proprietary data companies and the possible benefits for scholars and libraries from the possibility of collaborating with companies - vendors that serve data to libraries. More important, I will argue that there is a terrible threat hanging over disciplines such as literary studies and that we need to become avid archive entrepreneurs.

This web application shows that digital humanities can play an innovative role in historical research at the same time respecting traditional scientific methods and the needs of ground-breaking inter-disciplinary research. Indeed, the EMoBookTrade DB takes into account both the representation of different kinds of sources and the processing of data deriving from them. Therefore, thanks to a rigorously designed conceptual model, the front end allows for a simple and straightforward source and data representation together with a complex search engine, the results of which can be downloaded in a CSV format suitable for statistical analyses. This article also aims to propose an ontology of price setting and privilege grants, considered as events concerned with the history of the book and the economic history.

This web application shows that digital humanities can play an innovative role in historical research at the same time respecting traditional scientific methods and the needs of ground-breaking inter-disciplinary research. Indeed, the EMoBookTrade DB takes into account both the representation of different kinds of sources and the processing of data deriving from them. Therefore, thanks to a rigorously designed conceptual model, the front end allows for a simple and straightforward source and data representation together with a complex search engine, the results of which can be downloaded in a CSV format suitable for statistical analyses. This article also aims to propose an ontology of price setting and privilege grants, considered as events concerned with the history of the book and the economic history.

It touches briefly on issues of interdisciplinarity and disciplinary discontinuity. Specifically, it questions the shared basis of the discourse in terms of the terminology that is used and the research literature that is commonly drawn upon. By way of example, the article calls attention to the seemingly forgotten and in any case neglected literature concerned with the conceptualization of models and modelling in science and the humanities that was produced by cyberneticists and philosophers of science in the GDR and the USSR, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. It may be argued that in order to advance the discourse about modelling in the Digital Humanities, the discourse about modelling in the humanities would have to be unearthed and considered first or at least as well, particularly where it already crossed paths with disciplines adjacent to computing.

Spearheaded by Christine Lucia, the Michael Moerane Critical Edition (MMCE) project established the first digital scholarly edition of the surviving works by Moerane: 55–60 compositions that have been transcribed from tonic sol-fa into staff notation, edited from original scores, with a critical commentary, and historically contextualised. This article locates the MMCE within the discourse of digital scholarly editions and reconsiders them as archives, where considerations of power and politics are relevant and essential. This recontextualisation challenges the emerging field of digital humanities to interrogate questions of power, perceived objectivity, and the role of the physical within the praxis of creating and utilising digital scholarly editions. Questions of self-reflexivity, long embraced in archival discourse, could be utilised as necessary tools to consider humanities scholarship in digital spheres.

In the first part, thus, we will sketch the initial impulse that made the project come to life; then, we will outline the basic structure, features, and general characteristics of the database and its web application, briefly commenting on how that database design correlates and conflicts with the ontologies of historical sources underlying the reconstruction process. In the second part, we will try to tackle the question of whether projects of such tailoring should have a place within the spatial humanities, which seem to have shifted or solidified their epistemological center in poststructuralist, postmodern, postcolonial, and neo-geographic discourses, advocating for a reflected employment of digital spatial tools focussing on their different roles within the humanities instead of enforcing a growing divide between a theoretical navel-gazing and an atheoretical practice.

In order to review the history and current status of DH scholarship in China, the research team conducted historical analysis and bibliometrics to reveal the conception and development of DH in China. The research findings indicate that the history of the evolution of DH in China may best be divided into two stages. In the preliminary period, DH had just been introduced into China, and emphasis was placed on the exploration of its connotation. Once the concept had been explored and research about DH had been widely accepted, DH in China gradually entered into the phase of rapid development, in which China witnessed a wide variety of DH inquiries and applications in the field of library and information science, linguistics, history, literature, art, cultural heritage preservation, and so on. DH in China is facing opportunities as well as challenges with regard to digital practice, such as DH infrastructure, interdisciplinary research, and DH education. As an essential part of DH communities in China, libraries are playing an important role in resource construction, space sharing, and training services, which may provide strong support to deal with opportunities and challenges in the future.

It contains descriptions of recent events generated through distinct perspectives. Thus, the web is a valuable resource for contemporary historical research. However, its information is extremely ephemeral. Several research studies have shown that only a small amount of information remains available on the web for longer than one year. Web archiving aims to acquire, preserve and provide access to historical information published online. In April 2013, there were at least sixty four web archiving initiatives worldwide. Altogether, these archived collections of web documents form a comprehensive picture of our cultural, commercial, scientific and social history. Web archiving has also an important sociological impact because ordinary citizens are publishing personal information online without preservation concerns. In the future, web archives will probably be the only source of personal memories to many people. We provide some examples of tools that facilitate historical research over web archives highlighting their potential for Humanities.

This critique is informed by our experience of formulating user requirements for the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) project, and especially by a series of interviews we undertook with user-facing archivists working at EHRI partner institutions. We argue that the archival voices we recovered during these interviews articulate a range of concerns that clash with some of the major assumptions which frame current discussions about research infrastructure. In particular, we demonstrate that archival research is currently heavily mediated by archivists. And yet, inter-mediation is a theme that is insufficiently explored in recent theorising about research infrastructure. Contextualising our findings within some recent trends in archival science, we show that an infrastructure such as the EHRI must be build around the complex relationship between scholar, archivist and archive. We conclude by indicating how building infrastructures for humanities research may enable us to fruitfully re-conceptualise and re-energise this relationship by transposing it from the physical world to digital environments.

Eventually we'd have to think of creative ways to refill all this newly acquired space with innovative new resources, like perhaps expanded ward histories with personal testimonies from the youth, pictures from the ward Trunk-or-Treat, and fun videos of the Relief Society presidency, and maybe that would be the perfect excuse to convene a Ward Librarian Executive Committee Correlation Meeting.

This article investigates the condition of the humanities in the digital age as always already that of the ‘posthumanities’. The impact of the Derridean deconstruction of the sign as technological ‘trace’ is recalled as an antecedent to Stiegler’s conception, from his first volume of Technics and Time onwards, of humanity as indissociable from an exteriorizing technicity which gave rise to a third kind of, or ‘epiphylogenetic’, memory. The second part looks at Stiegler’s notion of ‘pharmacology’, his diagnostic of the enslavement of contemporary homo technicus through tele-technologies and his pragmatic search for socio-political, cultural and educational remedies. Taking my cue from his approach as well as inflecting Bolter and Grusin’s notion of ‘remediation’, I conclude with a final section envisaging tomorrow’s ‘remedial’ (post)- humanities, adducing as precursor examples a couple of creative practitioners (Mark Taylor and Gregory Ulmer) and emphasizing the rich potential of videogames in such a ‘re(-)creative’ process.

Impactul deconstrucției derridiene a semnului ca,,urmă tehnologică” este reamintit ca antecedent al concepției lui Stiegler, din primul volum al operei Tehnică și Timp până la celelalte opere, asupra umanității, ca fiind indisociabilă de tehnicitatea exterioară care a dat naștere celui de-al treilea tip de memorie,,epifilogenetică”.

Yet the full richness of the Du Chemin series remains largely unexplored by musicologists on two counts: large portions of it have never appeared in modern notation or score, and the final five books of the series survive in an incomplete state (with two of four original voice-parts missing).The Lost Voices Project explores the missing voices through the stylistic profile of the corpus as a whole. A thesaurus of musical devices provides a common vocabulary for a searchable database of thousands of analytical observations about the complete pieces. These in turn provide the foundation for dozens of reconstructions of the missing parts.

This article contributes to this discussion by presenting a method for detecting text reuse in a large corpus of digitized texts. Empirically, the article is based on the corpus of newspapers and journals from the collection of the National Library of Finland. Often, digitized repositories offer only partial views of what actually was published in printed form. The Finnish collection is unique, however, since it covers all published issues up to the year 1920. This article has a two-fold objective: methodologically, it explores how computational methods can be developed so that text reuse can be effectively identified; empirically, the article concentrates on how the circulation of texts developed in Finland from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century and what this reveals about the transformation of public discourse in Finland. According to our results, the reuse of texts was an integral part of the press throughout the studied period, which, on the other hand, was part of a wider transnational practice.

CLARIN aims to support and foster the next generation of research in the humanities, which will make use of advanced digital technologies. A distributed infrastructure is necessary in order to overcome the problems of the current fragmented environment, to create an ecosystem in which data and tools can be connected, and in which innovation will be encouraged. Case studies of early CLARIN demonstrators give a flavour of the possibilities of digital transformations in a number of humanities disciplines, and there is huge potential for important future new directions in literary and linguistic computing. For more widespread, thoroughgoing and effective transformations to take place, builders of infrastructure and researchers will need to negotiate and avoid potential pitfalls, and agree to achieve a certain measure of consensus in terms of priorities, categories and concepts. In the context of current debates about the nature of the humanities and their role in society, it will be necessary for digital humanists to be careful to preserve the unique character and importance of research in the humanities, while moving towards research infrastructures which will facilitate digital scholarship.

It begins by considering how DH has developed within the larger history of interdisciplinarity in the humanities, crossing boundaries within and between disciplines and sectors, and facilitating collaboration and knowledge exchange. It discusses the growth of large-scale digital projects in the humanities, shaped by the nature and scope of the data increasingly available to humanities researchers, by the new kinds of research questions that can be asked, but also by changes in broader funding and policy landscapes. It considers three recent projects which exemplify the value of DH in interdisciplinary contexts, before reflecting on how DH methods and approaches have influenced the shape of the Congruence Engine. It situates the practices of the Congruence Engine in the wider context of knowledge exchange, focusing in particular on the concept of 'trading zones', and draws out the complementarity between the bridging or translational role of DH and the systemic action research framing of the project. Finally, it highlights the value of responsible openness not just in relation to published research outputs but to research practice and process.

This model can be applied to a wide range of real‐world data sets. Examples of multilayer networks can be found in the domains of life sciences, sociology, digital humanities and more. Within the domain of graph visualization, there are many systems which visualize data sets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization, but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools, tasks and analytic techniques from within application domains.

"""Those Clunky Things You Have to Carry Around"": Textual Materiality in Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End.","Kozioł, Słavomir","Science Fiction Studies",="00917729",,="Nov2015","42","3","458","25","110630366",,"SF-TH, Inc.","Article","DIGITIZATION; DIGITAL humanities; RAINBOWS End (Book); VINGE, Vernor; HAYLES, N. Katherine",,"This article analyzes textual materiality in Vernor Vinge's Rainbows End, a 2006 sf novel set in the near future. The theoretical impetus for the analysis is provided by N. Katherine Hayles's investigation of ""the contemporary pressure toward dematerialization"" caused by the growing popularity of digital machines and the science of cybernetics, which, apart from influencing our understanding of the idea of the human, affects also our perception of textual embodiment. As a result, the materiality of books starts to be regarded as something expendable, an old-fashioned kind of interface with no meaning whatsoever. Disgreeing with this view of books, Hayles argues that textual materiality is one of their essential characteristics, as the physical form plays an important role in the cultural chain of these texts' production, assimilation, and influence. Taking into account works by Hayles and other writers dealing with book history, editing, archival science, and the digital revolution in general, the article proceeds to analyze, first, the conflict over digitization of an academic library as depicted in Vinge's novel, and second, the creative crisis that the main character--a poet--experiences as a result. Ultimately, it is argued, the relationship among author, text, and reader, as presented in the novel, illuminates debates about textual materiality taking place in contemporary digital-humanities scholarship.

However, their application usually remains fairly simple and superficial, and fails to exploit the resources which the digital era holds for discourse analysis to their full extent. This paper discusses the discourse-analytic potential of a more complex and advanced text analysis tool, which is already frequently employed in other approaches to textual analysis, notably topic modelling. We argue that topic modelling promises advances in areas where discourse analysis has traditionally struggled, such as scaling, repetition, and systematization, which go beyond the contributions of simpler frequency and collocation counts. At the same time, it does not violate the epistemological premises and methodological ethos of even the more radical theories of discourse, we will demonstrate. Finally, we present two small case studies to show how topic modelling—when used with appropriate parameters—can straightforwardly enhance our ability to systematically investigate and interpret discourses in large collections of text.

"Toward a Latinx digital humanities pedagogy: remixing, reassembling, and reimagining the archive.","Kreitz, Kelley","Educational Media International",="09523987",,="Dec2017","54","4","304","13","126799072","10.1080/09523987.2017.1391524","Taylor & Francis Ltd","Article","DIGITAL humanities; THEORY of knowledge; CULTURAL history; ARCHIVES; DIGITAL technology; HIGHER education; EDUCATION; Archives; Libraries and Archives; All Other Miscellaneous Schools and Instruction; Administration of Education Programs; Educational Support Services","Digital humanities; Latinx; pedagogy","This essay considers the teaching of the Latinx nineteenth century as a starting point for elucidating the unique interplay between pedagogy, epistemology, and ontology in our digital age. I argue that fields such as the Latinx nineteenth century, which must confront absences in the archive, foreground groundbreaking new pedagogical possibilities that draw on, but are not limited to, the computational methods that the digitization of archival texts has enabled. As scholars of Latinx Studies – as well as those in related fields such as hemispheric studies, black Atlantic studies, and indigenous studies – work to question the assumptions and omissions of our print-dominated past, digitization projects have become sites for recuperating lost voices, for breaking out of the disciplinary formations that have made sense of cultural history to find new patterns, and for increasing participation in the production of knowledge itself. While much of this work to date has centered on opening up new research trajectories, an emerging wave dedicated to digital humanities pedagogy in Latinx studies and related fields is engaging students in remixing, reassembling, and reimagining the archival record. Such new pedagogical approaches call for corresponding educational research methods and tools that can assess the effectiveness of the new digital humanities pedagogy in encouraging reflexivity about what we know and how we know it – and, ultimately, in contributing to the democratization of the production of knowledge.

This article chronicles the intellectual history of these encyclopedias and describes an experiment where their contents were reformatted into a data-driven web portal. This re-ordering and disruption allow for a different interaction with encyclopedic knowledge on wayang. For example, it enables the identification of statistical patterns in the connections between puppets that can be visualised as network diagrams. All encyclopedias distort and interpret the living tradition of wayang according to specific knowledge projects, and with different audiences in mind. In this article, I use the concept of epistemic virtues, borrowed from the philosophy of science, to help elucidate what these different encyclopedias aim to achieve and how they do so. Thinking in terms of epistemic virtues has the advantage that it underlines the culturally specific and historically contingent aspects of different epistemic projects.

Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future – or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline.

Through the text I wish to argue that the Digital Humanities should be seen as both an imperative and an exclusionary process by asking the following questions: What is the impact and social projection of the Digital Humanities in relation to the evolution of artists in residencies in the region? What are its methodological innovations, beyond the application of certain technologies? And in what way do they interconnect and hybridize knowledge(s) in an era of widespread prejudice? These questions, framed by a vision that contemplates, reflects and acts in favor of the different realities and responsibilities of the artists in residency model, are the ones through which first NACMM and afterwards Platform HARAKAT have evolved with the aim to promote the encounters of imaginaries and realities that shape the contemporary Mediterranean.

As a matter of fact, recently architectural research has begun to take an interest in the problem 'from within', working not only on the application of computer tools but, more consciously, on their configuration. The work carried out by the Sapienza research group is aimed at developing ontologies and inferential models specifically dedicated to the representation of historical buildings and is devoted to the implementation of a national GIS platform for the historical centres, the Risk Map of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism. This kind of work involves a series of methodological issues specially oriented to the definition of the role of the history of architecture in itself and its use for the conservation project. These arguments are developed within this essay, mainly focused on: type and quality of information deriving by the new procedures; interpretative components that fuel the new research methods; cost/benefit ratio in the use of 'analogue' and 'digital' approaches; future prospects of the two different (traditional and digital) investigative strategies. Moreover, both of the fields of digital research developed by the group (ontology and Risk Map) are here summarised. A kutatásban azóta jelent meg innovatív szempontként a digitális technológiák használata az építészet és környezete tanulmányozásában, amióta a képek és alfanumerikus adatok dinamikus társítása (bemeneti és kimeneti formában) elkezdődött: az információk következtetések és algoritmusok révén létrejött különböző kombinációja, valamint az új adatok ezekből következő generálása megszabadította a digitalizálást szigorúan instrumentális szerepétől és önmagában új módszertani megközelítést hozott létre. A közelmúltbeli építészeti kutatások tulajdonképpen „belülről"" mutattak érdeklődést a probléma iránt, nemcsak a számítógépes eszközök alkalmazásával, hanem még tudatosabban a konfigurációval is foglalkoztak. A Sapienza egyetemi kutatócsoport munkájának célja kifejezetten történeti épületek bemutatására szolgáló ontológiák és következtetési modellek kifejlesztésére irányul azzal a szándékkal, hogy megvalósuljon a történeti központokra vonatkozó olasz nemzeti térinformatikai platform, az olasz Kulturális Örökség és Turizmus Minisztériuma kockázati térképe. Ez a fajta kutatómunka módszertani problémák sorozatát foglalja magába, amelyek kifejezetten az építészettörténet szerepének meghatározására, valamint helyreállítási projektekben történő felhasználására irányulnak. Érveinket e tanulmányban fejtjük ki, elsősorban a következőkre összpontosítva: az új eljárásokból származó információ típusa és minősége; az új kutatási módszereket fellobbantó értelmező elemek; a költség-haszon arány az „analóg"" és a „digitális"" megközelítés alkalmazása esetén; a kétféle (hagyományos és digitális) vizsgálati stratégia jövőbeli kilátásai. Ezeken túlmenően összefoglalásra kerül a kutatócsoport által kifejlesztett digitális kutatás mindkét területe (ontológia és kockázati térkép) is.

Powers takes the Inhumanism and uncentering of Jeffers seriously but also necessarily pushes the reader beyond Jeffers's despair through a more complex look at the reciprocal relationships individuals have with nature. In Jeffers's poetry and its enduring impact we see the same emotional eruptions that are at the heart of Robinson's observations on dystopia, along with the intellectual simplifications Anson points out in critiquing America's ecofascist traditions. In drawing so significantly on Jeffers, the Dark Mountain Project is, in practice, not really pushing for new stories but rather retelling Jeffers's old one.

Approach/Methods: The concept of university course in digital humanities draws on the author's deep knowledge of digital humanities as well as the particular models of research project lifecycle. The concept consists of three elements: the description of educational aims, the graduate's profile, and the learning outcomes. Results and conclusions: The author proposes that university course in digital humanities should be provided as a part of specialization within a Master program for information professionals. Classes will give students a basic knowledge of a given discipline in the humanities and the theoretical aspects of digital humanities, as well as its structure and history. Students will also learn about information and knowledge organization, digital sources used in humanities, information systems, digital collections, research data management, and scholarly editions. Graduates would be equipped to work at research institutions running digital humanities projects or providing research infrastructure for digital humanists, e.g. academic libraries, museums, archives, digital humanities centers and laboratories. Practical implications: The concept may be used to prepare a detailed program of specialization by faculties offering information science programs. Although the concept has been developed in the context of Polish higher education, it can be modified and adapted successfully in other countries, especially in the EU countries which, like Poland, need to meet the European Qualifications Framework. Originality/Value: Formal university course in digital humanities for information professionals is not very common. The concept of a specialization within a Master program proposed in this article fills this gap so that a new generation of librarians and other information professionals will become more proficient intermediaries between humanists and information.

Koncepcja składa się z trzech elementów: opisów celów kształcenia, sylwetki absolwenta oraz zakładanych efektów kształcenia. Wyniki i wnioski: Koncepcja akademickiego kształcenia specjalistów informacji w zakresie humanistyki cyfrowej ma formę specjalizacji na studiach magisterskich. Podczas zajęć studenci zdobędą wiedzę w obszarze wybranej dyscypliny humanistycznej, teoretycznych aspektów humanistyki cyfrowej, jej organizacji oraz kontekstu powstania. Pogłębią swoją wiedzę i umiejętności na temat organizacji informacji i wiedzy, cyfrowych źródeł humanistycznych, systemów informacyjnych, bibliotek cyfrowych, zarządzania danymi badawczymi i publikacji tekstów naukowych. Absolwenci tej specjalizacji mogą znaleźć zatrudnienie w instytucjach naukowych rozwijających projektu z obszaru humanistyki cyfrowej lub dostarczających infrastrukturę badawczą dla humanistyki cyfrowej, np. w bibliotekach akademickich, muzeach, archiwach, centrach i laboratoriach humanistyki cyfrowej. Zastosowania praktyczne: Koncepcja specjalizacji może być wykorzystana do stworzenia szczegółowych programów specjalizacji przez jednostki uczelniane prowadzące studia z zakresu nauki o informacji. Koncepcja uwzględnia polską specyfikę studiów wyższych, jednak może być z powodzeniem zaadaptowana w innych krajach, szczególnie w krajach UE, które, tak jak Polska, muszą przestrzegać Europejskich Ram Kwalifikacji. Oryginalność/Wartość poznawcza: Kształcenie specjalistów informacji w obszarze humanistyki cyfrowej na poziomie studiów wyższych nie jest zbyt powszechne. Przedstawiona w artykule koncepcja kształcenia może pomóc w upowszechnieniu tego typu edukacji i tym samym przyczynić się do kształcenia nowych pokoleń bibliotekarzy oraz pozostałych specjalistów informacji jako wysoko wyspecjalizowanych mediatorów między humanistami a informacją.

It uses multiple quantitative research methods-- including distant-reading practices of the Digital Humanities and quantitative content analysis--to argue that Variety's decisions about when and how to cover the film and radio industries need to be understood as a series of specific internal strategies made in relation to a dynamic business environment. Situating the project's digitization of Variety as a form of philology, the authors argue that corpus digitization should be considered a scholarly practice, not simply a technical one.

The tool enables expert‐assessed labeling, curation, visualization and Classification of color features based on their perceived context and aesthetic quality. It is the first of its kind that incorporates foreground‐background information made possible by modern deep learning segmentation methods.

The article first identifies the trope of Siberian captivity, which it refutes using two digital humanities methods: geographic information system (GIS) mapping and text analysis. The article then raises a series of factors, covering both experiences, memoirs and novels of First World War captivity in Russia and also Nazi propaganda, to show a long-standing association between Siberia and German captivity in Russia and the Soviet Union. Finally, the article explores West German politics and memory culture to argue ultimately that the trope of Siberian captivity persisted as a result of West German anti-Communist policies and an attempt to displace blame and complicity for the war. While German memory changed between the 1950s and the present and although scholars have worked to expose many misrepresentations of the war that started in West Germany in the 1950s, this is the first study to examine the idea of Siberian captivity and its links to POWs in the USSR.

Three trial runs of full earth simulations in VR in classroom environments were conducted using high-end VR hardware. The trials were conducted with Geography and Digital Humanities students and the aim was to evaluate the use of immersive VR would enhance learner engagement. The technology acceptance model was used to some extent to get appropriate survey data and an inductive approach to thematic analysis was applied. Based on the data collected there seemed a reasonable evidence base that students found the tool relatively easy to use and it enhanced their understanding and engagement. The findings are in line with those of previous studies which show that immersive VR environments create a strong sense of perceived presence which leads to higher learner engagement and motivation.

This case study describes a long-term collaboration between a Digital Humanities (DH) librarian and a History professor. We trace our two-year partnership from inception and test-run in a small undergraduate seminar to a scaled-up and carefully-designed DH intervention for visualizing spatial and temporal historical arguments in a course with three times the number of students. The article chronicles our process and analyzes the data from the assessment model we designed for reflecting on the efficacy of the intervention and the success of the partnership. Our collaborative model suggests the value of a partnership built over time, based on shared pedagogical values (in this case, student learning outcome-driven pedagogy and scaffolded instruction) and transparent labor practices.

In this article, we discuss the benefits and challenges associated with the collaborative design, development and evaluation of real-world projects with community stakeholders serving as clients. Over the past decade, we have developed and used Webscapes, a theoretical model that serves as the framework for the creation of these projects. We define Webscapes as information landscapes, delivered over the web, which include a rich variety of content; challenging, cognitive explorations; intuitive navigation structures; and user-oriented interfaces. We describe the characteristics of the model and include reflections from students and community partners about accomplishments and challenges they faced. We also provide examples and discussion of Webscape projects, several of which have been completed, two that are ongoing and one that is in the early stage of development.

Theorists have not given patterns the attention they deserve. Therefore it is far from clear what patterns are and to what purpose scholars may use them. This paper presents eight propositions on patterns which hold true for patterns found ‘by hand’ and patterns found ‘by computation’. One such is that a pattern is discernible in behaviour when we subject it to the intentional stance, as the philosopher Daniel Dennett argues. Here behaviour is part of an intentional system. This paper’s argument is that the patterns found ‘by computation’ too are part of an intentional system. To substantiate this claim this paper discusses two important examples of detecting computational patterns in the domain of the humanities.

The if claim is addressed with a detailed rebuttal to Angus Fletcher's 'Why Computers Will Never Read (or Write) Literature."" A counter-argument based upon key AI concepts, the historical progress of AI, and landmark failures and breakthroughs brings readers up to date on the current state of AI as it relates to narrative studies. Numerous examples explain why the cycle of AI winters and springs is now broken, and there is a new global AI arms race. Scholars now have a windfall of increasingly sophisticated, multi-million dollar models that can analyze and generate narrative. Still, in light of the inherent complexity of natural language and the current limitations of even these state-of-the-art AI models, a human-in-the-loop is essential for the foreseeable future. We attempt to allay common yet misplaced concerns by reasserting the centrality of the human scholar to guide and interpret while using these tools. Leveraging these new AI models will yield new insights for narrative studies, and this important work will include shaping the language of fairness, equality, and ethics of models that increasingly impact the lives of billions. We invite narrative scholars to participate in this growing interdisciplinary movement that chooses active engagement over passive critique.

The proof has three main components: (1) computer artificial intelligences (including machine-learning algorithms) run on the CPU's Arithmetic Logic Unit, which performs all of its computations using symbolic logic; (2) symbolic logic is incapable of causal reasoning; and (3) causal reasoning is required for processing the narrative components of literature, including plot, character, style, and voice. This proof is presented both in logical form and as a narrative. The narrative's beginning traces the origin of automated symbolic-logic literature processors back before modern computing to the 1930s Cambridge scholar I. A. Richards. The middle recounts how these processors became a basis of New Criticism, Cultural Poetics, and other twentieth- and twenty-first-century theories of literary ""interpretation."" And the end explores how those theories' preference for symbolic logic over causal reasoning leaves them vulnerable to the same blind spot that early modern scientists detected in medieval universities: the inability to explain why literature (or anything else) works—and therefore the inability to comprehend how to use it.

Previously, we asked three existing centers for digital humanities in Germany ( Trier Center for Digital Humanities, Cologne Center for eHumanities, Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities) to answer a set of 16 questions about the specific characteristics and functions of their institution. This information was used to create an overview of digital humanities centers in Germany that addresses the following areas: (1) Structure and development, (2) profile, functions and services, (3) users, networks and projects, and (4) future perspectives and strategy. At the end of the article we provide a conclusion and discuss the future prospects for digital humanities centers. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Cet article décrit la nécessité et les exigences relatives à l'infrastructure de l'information pour les sciences humaines. Auparavant les dirigeants de trois centres d'humanités numériques bien établis en Allemagne (Trier Center for Digital Humanities, Cologne Center for eHumanities, Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities) ont été demandés de répondre à 16 questions sur les caractéristiques et fonctions essentielles de leur institution et d'en établir ainsi une brève fiche descriptive. L'auteur se base sur ces profils pour donner un aperçu des centres d'humanités numériques en Allemagne et examiner notamment les domaines suivants: (1) la structure et la genèse, (2) le profil, les tâches et les services, (3) les utilisateurs, les réseaux et les projets, et enfin (4) les perspectives futures et la stratégie. L'article se termine par une conclusion sur la situation actuelle de l'infrastructure de l'information dans les sciences humaines numériques et fournit également quelques considérations sur les développements futurs de ce sujet. (French) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Dieser Artikel thematisiert den Bedarf für und die Anforderungen an Informationsinfrastrukturen für die Geisteswissenschaften. Im Vorfeld wurden die Verantwortlichen dreier etablierter Digital Humanities-Zentren ( Trier Center for Digital Humanities, Cologne Center for eHumanities, Göttingen Centre for Digital Humanities) in Deutschland gebeten, insgesamt 16 Fragen zu wesentlichen Charakteristika und Funktionen zu beantworten, und so einen kurzen Steckbrief der jeweiligen Institution zu erstellen. Auf Basis dieser Steckbriefe erfolgt ein Überblick zu Digital Humanities-Zentren in Deutschland, der im Wesentlichen die Bereiche (1) Struktur und Genese, (2) Profil, Aufgaben und Dienste, (3) Nutzer, Vernetzung und Projekte und schließlich (4) Ausblick und Strategie näher betrachtet. Der Artikel schließt mit einem Fazit zur aktuellen Situation der Informationsinfrastruktur in den digitalen Geisteswissenschaften und stellt darüber hinaus einige Betrachtungen zur künftigen Weiterentwicklung des Themas an.
